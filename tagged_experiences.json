    "content": "Given a company's hierarchy graph with Employees and departments, I had to find the closest department between a list of employees. Working solution was required and I had construct the dependency graph as well. The starting point was company which had multiple departments and in the deparments, there were multiple employees.\nI gave the Lowest Common Ancestor approach and ran the solution for multiple test cases. The verdict was NO Hire. The reasons provided from the HR -\na. No clarifying questions were asked.\nb. The edge cases like - if the employee didn't exist wasn't covered. (I had a discussion with the interviewer on this specifically and implemented the fail safe)\nc. Time complexity wasn't computed correctly.\nPS - To make the approach more efficient, I proposed to store the paths from the root to the deparments and just check which deparment the employee belongs to while getting the closest department. But the interviewer didn't let me discuss on this approach and kept insisting on making the LCA approach better without sheding any light on what exactly he felt the issue was.(space or time?)\nPlease write in the comments if you have a better solution.\n\n\nHLD Round - Atlassian Tags management.\nThe interviewer was a Principal engineer and maturely handled the interview. Asked the API design, DB schema, microservices and then moved on to discussion on scaled up system. He asked questions on which components can act as a bottleneck and how can they be scaled.\nThe verdict was positive.\n\n\nLLD Round - Mobile Snake system design\nI was a bit overwhelmed because i hadn't attempted this question before and there were multiple requirements that were needed to be implemented. Finally, the interviewer wanted to see the position of head and tail in the console. I gave a working solution and was able to run all the use cases which were asked.\n\n\nThe verdict was NO Hire. The reasons provided from the HR -\na. Unit Test cases were not written\nb. Exception handling wasn't done.\nc. corner cases weren't covered\n\n\nPS - I was proud of myself after implementing a running solution. But the HR feedback was absurd.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\nHope I will be able to help others planning to give Atlassian interviews."

    "content": "### **Background**\n\n* **Education:** Tier-3\n* **Experience:** 5 Years (3 Years in FAANG)\n* **Designation:** SE-2\n* **Current Company:** Startup\n\n---\n\n### **Interview Experience**\n\nI applied to multiple SDE2 openings on **the** portal. I got **a** call from a recruiter. I'll consider the recruiter contact day as Day 0.\n\n#### Day 1 : Karat Interview (1 hr)\n\n##### System design Questions\n\n1.) We are working on a clone of Facebook. We want to add a numeric count to every post showing how many friends the post's author has at the time of viewing the post. The database schema looks like this:\n**USER**\n* `user_id` (primary key)\n* `name`\n* `created_date`\n\n**USER RELATIONSHIP**\n* `friendship_id` (primary key, unique to each relationship)\n* `user_id` (indexed)\n* `user2_id` (indexed)\n* `start_date`\n\nFocusing on the database, how would you implement the friend-count feature? Note that we will soon be more popular than Facebook, so the solution needs to scale.\n\n2.) We are working on a clone of Google Docs. The software has the following features and limitations:\n* Multiple users may work on a single document at the same time.\n* A document must be handled by a single server, no matter how many users **there are**.\n* We have a fixed number of servers which will be sufficient to handle our **expected load** properly.\n\nOur load balancer uses a round-robin system to permanently assign documents to each server, so **that** each will have an equal number of documents. Do you have any concerns about this load **balancing** system? In those cases, how would you fix the **scalability issue**?\n\n3.) Which consistency model is more appropriate for each of these applications: **strong** or **eventual** consistency? Why?\n* An API call that needs to respond within 20 milliseconds, used to retrieve **video stream metadata**. The metadata includes things like the author name, rating, and **view count**.\n* A web analytics platform recording every single click on a popular web page.\n* A banking system that makes deposits and payments to checking accounts.\n\n4.) **Another scenario was that** there was a bug on an application, and you ended up having a lot of failed requests. You have a database that stores all IDs, and you also have large log files from about 500 different production servers that log the IDs of the successful requests. How would you come up with a solution to find the IDs that were missing?\n\n##### Coding Question\nThe question was similar to [68. Text Justification](https://leetcode.com/problems/text-justification/description/) and had one **follow-up**. I was able to fully solve the question and **gave my** approach for the **follow-up**.\n\n---\n\n#### Day 6 : Data Structures Interview (1 hr)\n\nYou have `N` services **in** a network. You are given which servers are connected and the connection latency. For example `[1, 2, 200]` means service `1` calls service `2` and it has a latency of 200ms. You are given `Q` queries where you have to output the minimum latency from Service `X` to Service `Y`.\n\n**The** interviewer wanted to discuss why classic DFS and BFS should not be the solution, how **Dijkstra's** algorithm **would** work, **what the** other ways **are** to solve this, and **the** time complexity.\n\nIn the end, I provided the solution using **Dijkstra's** algorithm.\n\n**Rating:** Hire (Medium confidence)\n\n---\n\n#### Day 7 : Code Design Interview (1 hr)\n\n**Customer Satisfaction**\n\na) Imagine we have a customer support ticketing system. The system allows customers to rate the support agent out of 5. To start with, write a function which accepts a rating, and another which will show me all of the agents and the average rating **each** one has received, ordered from highest to lowest.\nc) Now I want to be able to see who the best agents are each month. Change the implementation so I can get that information.\n\nI **followed the** `Test-Driven Development (TDD)` approach as mentioned by the recruiter in the preparation guide. Atlassian recruiters are really helpful.\n\n**Rating:** Hire (Medium confidence)\n\n---\n\n#### Day 13 : System Design Interview (1 hr)\n\n**Question: Tagging Management Service**\n\nAtlassian has a number of different products, each containing different types of content. As an example, let\u2019s look at three of our products:\n\n* Jira \u2013 Issues\n* Confluence \u2013 Pages\n* Bitbucket \u2013 Pull requests\n\nWe want to build a system that allows users to tag content from different products, and then to view content by tags. A goal of this system is that it should be built **in** a product-agnostic way so that we could add new products in the future without a large amount of work. There are three key experiences that we want to build here:\n\n* As a user, I can add, remove, and update tags on content.\n* As a user, I can click on a tag and see all content that has been associated with that tag.\n* As a user, I can see a dashboard of popular tags.\n\n**The** recruiter focused on API Specification, DB Schema, DB Choice (SQL/NoSQL), Communication protocols, SQS vs **RabbitMQ** vs Kafka, **and** Rate **limiting**.\n\n**Rating:** Hire (Low confidence)\n\nThe recruiter mentioned the reason for the \"low confidence hire\" was that the **interviewer** felt the design was a little rushed.\n\n---\n\n#### Day 16 : Managerial Interview (1 hr)\n\n**This involved** standard managerial-type **questions** based on my previous work experiences.\n\n**Rating:** Hire (High confidence)\n\n---\n\n#### Day 20 : Values Interview (45 mins)\n\n**The questions were similar to those mentioned** in the following LeetCode article:\n[[Disclosed] Atlassian Full Loop Question [SSE & SDE 2]](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6974858/disclosed-atlassian-full-loop-question-b-ulje/)\n\n**Rating:** Hire (High confidence)\n\n---\n\n##### Day 31 : **Got** confirmation about the HC Result\n##### Day 35 : **The** recruiter scheduled a team matching meeting\n##### Day 38 : **I had the** team matching call\n##### Day 41 : **I received the offer**\n\n---\n\n##### Compensation:\n[Atlassian | P40 | India [Accepted]](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/7069410/atlassian-p40-india-accepted-by-anonymou-p3qh/)\n\n---\n\n##### Remarks\nHere are my thoughts on my recent 6-month job search:\n\n* **The Market:** It's tough out there. Interviews are hard, and there is little room for mistakes.\n* **My Journey:** It was a long road. I was rejected by many companies like Apple, Dream11, Microsoft (2 times), Arcesium, Myntra, Tekion, Google, Salesforce (Ghosted), and Uber (Ghosted) before I finally got offers from Microsoft and Atlassian.\n* **What Helped:** My previous experience at a FAANG company made my resume stand out and helped me get more calls for interviews.\n* **My Advice:** Just keep going. Don't let the rejections discourage you. Keep interviewing, and you will find the right job."

    "content": "0. ### Karat Round\r\n    - Systems and debugging related questions - 5 questions. 3 of such are mentioned below. The theme was to ask clarifying questions and then suggesting and answer. \r\n        - For company XYZ, there is an old model for a smart fridge which sends data to the cloud for computation. The company now plans to launch a new fridge where the processing power will be in the new fridge. What possible issues do you forsee? (Answered, low processing power and slow computations. Interviewer seemed content. Constant firmware upgrade and lack of hardware upgrade since it's on client's side are good answers too.)\r\n        - A children's application converts children's vague drawing to animal animation and then the customers can choose the background for these animations from a fixed set of backgrounds. The animation is resource intensive. How do you plan to reduce the use of resources for this application? (Asked interviewer to clarify the nature of this animal animation converter, interviewer said, let's assume it identifies an animal and then animates. So suggested caching certain animations, once we identify an animal.)\r\n        - The company receives data from multiple sources and calculate stats on these sources. One such source is returning bad data, how do we tackle the situation? (Asked which type of stat are we calculating, average might be fine but median might not be. Interviewer said, it's a redundant stat, so the conversation went towards not pushing too many requests to the broken source for it recover. Also, to vote out the stat itself.)\r\n    - DSA Questions - 2 questions. I only recall one question. The second one was a follow-up to this one so it was similar in nature.\r\n        - You are given 2 lists, one is called entry, which is timestamp sorted list of names who badged in while entering the conference room and the second one is called exit, which is timestamp sorted list of names who badged out while leaving the conference room. People often make mistakes, they either forget to badge in or badge out. You need to make a list of such people who have made this mistake/violation.\r\n\r\n1. ### DSA round - 1 question\r\n    - Question related to creating a data structure which represented incrementing karma on some platform, similar to increasing likes for a YT video. The question on leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/all-oone-data-structure/\r\n\r\n2. ### DSA round - 1 question\r\n    - We want to implement a middleware router for our web service, which based on the path returns different strings (these would represent \u201cfunctions to invoke\u201d in a real application). \r\n    Usage:\r\n`Router.addRoute(\"/bar\", \"result\")`\r\n`Router.callRoute(\"/bar\") -> \"result\"`\r\nImplemented hashmap based solution wrapped in a class quickly. Then the follow-up.\r\n    - Search using wildcard is now possible\r\n`Router router = Router()`\r\n`router.addRoute(\"/foo\", \"foo\")`\r\n`router.addRoute(\"/bar/*/baz\", \"bar\")`\r\n`router.callRoute(\"/bar/a/baz\") -> bar`\r\n    Here the solution needed Trie. I suggested the same and interviewer said it was the right solution here. This trie\r\nneeds to be implemented by splitting the route by slash and keeping each word as a trieNode.\r\n\r\n3. ### System design question - 1 question\r\n    - Design a system where you return top confluence pages for the home screen. Top is decided by some metric say likes. The top screen needs to refreshed when new top posts come in. The top suggestions page should be renderable in any device, mobile, tablet, desktop. Final follow-up was about user recommendation since I clarified in my FR that this is going to all time top posts and not based on user recommendations. \r\n\r\n4. ### Managerial round - experience and behavioural questions. \r\n    - Generic behavioural questions but a [useful resource](https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/values-interviewing-atlassian.pdf)\r\n\r\n5. ### Values round - behavioural questions.\r\n    - Similar to above. Managerial is more about your experience and projects while values is more behavioural, I guess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Final call: No hire, despite green (hire call) on all rounds\r\n\r\n"

At Atlassian \u2013 there are multiple groups, and each can have one or more groups. Every employee is part of a group. You are tasked with designing a system that could find the closest common parent group giv a target set of employees in the organization.\nb) The Atlassian hierarchy sometimes can have shared group across an org or employees shared across different groups \u2013 How will the code evolve n this case if the requirement is to provide ONE closest common group\nc) The system now introduced 4 methods to update the structure of the hierarchy in the org. Supose these dynamic updates are done in separate threads while getCommonGroupForEmployees is being called, How ill your system handled reads and writes into the system efficiently such that at any given time getCommonGroupForEmployees always reflects the latest updated state of the hierarchy?\nd) The company consists of a single level of groups with no subgroups. Each group has a set of employees.\n\nExpanding Tennis Club\na) Implement a function that given a list of tennis court cookings with start and finish times, returns a plan assigning each booking to a specific court, ensuring each court is used by only one booking at a time and using the minimum amount of courts with unlimites number of courts available.\nAn example of the booking record might look like\n\nClass BookingRecord:\nId: int//ID of the booking\nStart_time: int\nFinish_time: int\n\nAnd our function is going to look like:\n\nList assignCourts(List bookingRecords)\n\nb) After each booking, a fixed amount of time, X, is needed to maintain the court before it can be rented again\nc) Court only need maintainenece after X amount of usage\nHow would you modify the code if each court also had a Y maintainence time that occurred after X bookings?\nThe function should now become something like\nDef assign_court_with_maintainence(booking_records: list{BookingRecord],\n\nMaintainence_time: int,\n\nDurability: int) -> list[Court]:\nd) The original problem can be made simpler by removing the \u201cassigning each booking to a specific court\u201d part. The candidate needs to find the minimum number of courts needed to accommodate all the bookings\ne) Check if booking conflict - Write a function that if given two bookings to check if they conflict with each other\n\nCommodity Prices\nImagine you are given a stream of data points consisting of <timestamp, commodityPrice> you are supposed to return the maxCommodityPrice at any point in time.\nThe timestamps in the stream can be out of order, or there can be duplicate timestamps, we need to update the commodityPrice at that particular timestamp if an entry for the timestamp already exists\nCreate an in-memory solution tailored to prioritize frequent reads and writes for the given problem statement\nCan we reduce the time complexity of the getMaxCommodityPrice to O(1) if the language does not support it? This can be done using a variable to keep the maxPrice value, but we need to update it when performing the upsert operations.\n\nPopular content\nImagine you are given a stream of content ids along with an associated action to be performed on them\nExample of contents are video, pages, posts etc. There cam be two actions associated with a content id:\n\u2022 increasePopularity -> increases the popularity of the content by 1. The popularity increases when someone comments on the content or likes the comtent\n\u2022 decreasePopularity-> decreases the popularity of the content by 1. The popularity decreases when a spam bot\u2019s/users comments are deleted from the content or its likes are removed from the content\n\u2022 content ids are positive integers\nImplement a class that can return the mostPopular content id at any time while consuming the stream of content ids and its associated action.

    "content": "I gave atlassian interview DSA round few days back. The question was very similar to the leetcode voting system. This round happened on local system. Unlike here we dont get the inputs and expected output in the question. We have to identiify that based on the statements given in the question. \\nIt took me some time to identify the input correctly. \\nQuestion - \\nProcess a list of ballots, and return all candidates sorted in descending order by their \\ntotal number of points.\\n// List<String> getResults(List<Ballot> ballots)\\nWe pass in a list of ballots and we return a list of candidate names in descending order of the \\ntotal number of points that each candidate received. Assume that we extract the candidates\\' names from the votes as we process them. A voter is allowed to vote for up to three different candidates. The order of the votes is important. The first vote that a voter places is worth three points. The second vote is worth two points. The third vote is worth one point. The function should return a list of candidates in descending order of the total number of points received by the candidate.\\n\\nThe solution was pretty simple (can check solutions on leetcode). However the interviewer asked follow up questions on this which was the tricky part. \\n1. How to handle the scenario where the candidates have the same points? What strategies can be used.\\n2. He proposed 2 strategies and I was supposed to implement both of them based on the input. \\n\\n1st Strategy -> supposed 2 candidates (A, B) have same points. We have to declare the candidate as winner whoever reaches the winning point 1st. \\n2nd strategy -> votes placed in the ballot. Whoever has the maxium votes in ballot at 0th index then 1st index and then last index.\\n\\nFor strategy 1 -> I implemented a doubly linked list having each node as set. Basically I was trying to implement the ALL O(1) problem\\'s solution. With help of this I can return the 0th index on the list\\'s node.\\nFor strategy 2 -> I tried maintaing an array of points at each index for each candidate. EG - A: [0,0,0]\\n\\nThe interviewer was looking for a better solution for strategy 1. I checked multiple time with him if he was looking for a continuous output - so that I can implement something similar to heap. But he told that only after getting all the votes we wanted to declare the winner.\\n\\nCan someone think of a better solution to the problem?\\n"

Each customer may have purchased licenses for several of these products. Every product has different types of entities, such as Sprints, Features, and Tasks in Jira, documents in Confluence, and Code Repositories in BitBucket. The owner can assign hashtags to these entities.\\n\\n**Example**: For a project called \\'Project-XYZ\\', all related Jira tickets, user stories, Confluence documents, and BitBucket code reviews can be tagged with `#project-xyz` for easier tracking.\\n\\n**Functional requirements**:\\n1. **Fetches all tagged entities**: The system should efficiently retrieve all entities owned by a customer that are tagged with a specific hashtag, across multiple products.\\n2. **Top 10 Hashtags**: Design a solution to identify the top 10 hashtags globally (across all customers) with the most tagged entities. Similar to \"Top-K leader board problem\"\\n\\n**Non-functional requirements:**\\n1. The system should be highly configurable to allow new product types and entity types to be added.\\n2. Hashtags are dynamic, with no pre-defined set, meaning users can create any tag.\\n\\nThe focus was on schema design and choosing the right database and mapping structure for efficient querying.\\n\\n#### _For Frontend Roles:_\\nA friend shared insights from the frontend system design round. The task was to design a dynamic sprint dashboard where users could modify the dashboard by adding columns such as \\u201CBacklog,\\u201D \\u201CScheduled,\\u201D \\u201CIn Progress,\\u201D etc. Each column could contain entities like tasks or stories.\\n\\nThe key areas of focus were:\\n- **Reusable UI Components**: The UI components, such as tasks or stories, should be reusable. For example, a Task should be rendered using the same UI component each time.\\n- **Versioning**: Instead of modifying existing UI components, the idea of creating a new version of the component, similar to versioning in backend systems (e.g., Maven), was emphasized.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### [V.Imp.] Management Round: Don\\'t go unprepared!!\\nThis round is for Senior Engineer roles, and **it\\'s MANDATORY to clear, even if you ace the technical rounds!** People with 5-6 years of experience might not have had the chance to lead a project where they managed others acting as a project lead. But this round expects candidates to have managerial experience.\\n\\nI strongly recommend checking `URL-1`, Atlassian\\u2019s official documentation. It lists their 5 values with 2 sample questions for each. Trust me, interviewers ask straight from this!\\n\\nIf you lack managerial experience, don\\u2019t admit it. Prepare responses that demonstrate your ability to lead. For example, if asked about a time when you improved someone\\'s performance, don\\u2019t just mention helping them to learn a technology. Instead, say your colleague was newly promoted to a Senior role and was having a hard time managing resources and tracking progress. You helped him with best practices that you learned from your experience, such as setting up a dedicated project call outside of the daily standup to thoroughly assess progress. This response shows you understand team dynamics and can coach others.\\n\\nEvery answer should aim to showcase strong managerial experience and knowledge of best practices. The interviewer will be a manager!\\n\\n___\\n\\n### Values round\\nEverything I said about the managerial round applies exactly to this one as well.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Preparation\\nFor details on how I prepared, check out my [Google interview experience blog](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/5547675/Google-Interview-questions-and-preparation/)."

For example, to improve system latency, you can mention adding cache, CDN for static content, adding database indexes, etc. Each question has 5 minutes allotted, and HR will share a format for the same.\\nResult: Selected\\n1st Technical with Atlassian LLD or Design (1 hour):\\n\\nAtlassian often asks about designing a rate limiter, which was the case for me as well (x requests in y time). I proposed a moving window approach, but I was removing all requests from the queue within the time window. The interviewer suggested processing only one request, reducing the time complexity from O(windowLength) to O(1). The interview went well, and the interviewer was very friendly. We finished a bit early and talked about common hobbies, etc.\\n2nd Technical with Atlassian or DS:\\n\\nIn this round, they asked about a voting algorithm where each person gets votes in order (e.g., (ABC) -> A having 3 votes, B 2, and C 1). The goal was to return the most voted person. This question is common in many Atlassian rounds. Then, they asked a similar version, focusing on how I would handle the algorithm, follow the Open-Closed Principle, and add a function to the interface. The coding rounds were not hard; just follow standard design processes.\\n3rd HLD:\\n\\nDesigned a service to get the most viewed or liked page. Discussion points included:\\nHow to maintain a list of likes. Should I maintain viewed IDs or just a count? Pros and cons.\\nHandling a scenario where a new page becomes the most liked next year while still showing users the previous year\\'s top page. I proposed using a NoSQL database mapped to each day with a list of pages, but the interviewer preferred Cassandra DB, stating we wouldn\\u2019t consider this year\\'s data. I was unsure how to solve this, resulting in a pass with a P40 ranking, which decreased my interest in Atlassian.\\n4th Managerial:\\n\\nI expected a mix of technical and behavioral questions, but it was entirely behavioral. The interviewer expected STAR format answers, and I felt I didn\\'t perform well. Overall, it was a simple round.\\n5th Values:\\n\\nFocused on Atlassian\\'s five values. Prepare a story for each value and answer in the STAR format. Nothing special.\\nOverall, I did well in the Karat round and the first two technical rounds but was weak in the HLD and managerial rounds. The main rejection came from the managerial round, but I was approved in the values round. In my experience, cracking Atlassian isn\\'t that hard; you don\\'t need to solve all of LeetCode and lots of DS questions. Prepare some design patterns, stay confident, stay calm during interviews, and have a sip of water if needed. However, I don\\'t like their practice of downgrading to lower roles, which they do often. I also heard they revoked offers for freshers, so I was a bit skeptical during the interview.\\n\\nRequest for Community:\\nI am good at DS and have passed DS rounds in all my interviews but have failed in HLD and sometimes in LLD. Any tips for improvement?"

More focus was given on building the actual functionality and the scale of the system.\\n\\n4. Management Round - The interviewer mostly asked questions around the software development life cycle, how will you lead a project from end to end, how will you split the work amongst your peers etc.,\\n\\n5. Cultural And Values Fit - Mostly behavioral and cultre fitment questions. You should do good here if you follow the STAR pattern to answer the questions.\\n\\nAll the interviewers at Atlassian were very humble and knowledgable. I was really impressed with the interviewers and enjoyed talking to them. One of the best interviews I\\'ve had so far. I got an acceptance from the recruiter in ~1 week.

    "content": "Hi All,\\n\\nRecently I had a really nice experience with Atlassian.\\n\\nThe entire process took about 1.5 months.\\n\\n**HR Discussion (40 mins)**\\n\\n1. Detailed discussion on current projects and current roles and responsibilities.\\n2. What data structures are used in LRU Cache. \\n3. How would you design an in-memory cache to store a stream integer values.\\n4. What are the major pros and cons of using a hashing data-structure.\\n5. What are the key factors according to you that defines good code.\\n6. What are microservices? How many microservices do you own in current role? Detailed discussion about how I came to own them and what do they do. How do they create impact to the larger picture?\\n\\nI was a bit surprised to see HR asking technical questions. \\n\\n**Round 1 - Low-Level Design (1 hour)**\\nAll coding rounds needed working code in IDE and supposed to write test cases.\\nThis was a low level design round and lasted 1 hour. Allowed to use any IDE of your choice. I was asked to code the LLD for API rate limiter.\\nDesing API Rate Limiter. Solved it. Added more complexity. Was able to solve with some hints.\\n\\n**Round 2 - Code Design (1 hour)**\\nGiven a list of [FileName, FileSize, [Collection]] - Collection is optional, i.e., a collection can have 1 or more files. Same file can be a part of more than 1 collection. \\nHow would you design a system\\n* To calculate total size of files processed.\\n* To calculate Top K collections based on size.\\nExample:\\n```\\nfile1.txt(size: 100)\\nfile2.txt(size: 200) in collection \"collection1\"\\nfile3.txt(size: 200) in collection \"collection1\"\\nfile4.txt(size: 300) in collection \"collection2\"\\nfile5.txt(size: 100)\\n```\\nOutput:\\n```\\nTotal size of files processed: 900\\nTop 2 collections:\\n- collection1 : 400\\n- collection2 : 300\\n```\\n\\t\\n**Round 3 - System Design (1 hour)**\\nAtlassian has a number of different products, each containing different types of content. As an example, let\\u2019s look at four of our products:\\nJira - Issues\\nConfluence - Web Pages\\nBitBucket - Pull Request\\nTrello - Board\\n\\nHow would you add tags for related pages across all Atlassian products.\\nHow would you scale up the system to 100 Million tag requests a day.\\n\\nApproach:\\n* Identify the functional and non-functional requirements.\\n* Based on requirements specified\\n\\t* Identify how would you store the data/DB to used.\\n\\t* HLD: Identify the system components on a high-level and how will they interact with each other.\\n\\n**Round 4 - Values (1 hour)**\\nMultiple behavioral based questions to check culture fit.\\n\\n**Round 5 - Management Round (1 hour)**\\nDeep discussion about past experiences.\\n\\nReceived an offer after a week.\\n\\nNote: Unlike other companies, Atlassian doesn\\'t ask LC questions. They focus on seeing whether the candidate can solve real world problems. Really wish all companies moved to this pattern of interview."

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-teams-by-votes/)\\n3. **System Design Round** - Mantain calm and composure, they are not looking for a full proofed solution, start with gathering the Functional and Non Functional requirements, followed up with API Design including Protocols and followed by Database design. The interviewer would keep on asking questions regardin the implementation. You may or may not get a chance to discuss the high level diagram, but make sure to list down all the services involved. Problem --> Design a tag management system for JIRA and Confluence, which is standard for Atlassian.\\n4. **Management Round** - Best Round ever. The recruiter would tell about the principles and values with Atlassian, it\\'s a deep dive into the projects coupled with management fit in the team.\\n5. **Cultural And Values Fit** - Atlassian doesn\\'t hire for a specific team, the process remains the same across all the teams which make it easier to switch between teams in case you are not happy once you join. Pretty standard HR questions. Remain polite, don\\'t overspeak. Try to inoculate the STAR Values and the Company\\'s values into your answers. The recruiter would follow up with you to mention all the questions that are going to be involved in this round. The recruiters at Atlassian are really nice and thorough."

I hope it helps anyone else out there that is interviewing with Atlassian.\\n\\nYOE: <1\\n\\nPhone screen and System Design Round:\\n\\nI applied to atlassian online and got a call a week later form the recruiter. She asked me a few basic questions revolving around my work and my expereince. She did ask specifically \"have you contributed to the architecture or design for any of the projects that you have been on?\", which I thought was a question that I should share. \\n\\n\\nRound 1: System design \\nAfter the phone screen I got invited to do the first round which was a system design round. They asked me to build an application that would schedule reminders for users who called it. I chose a MySQL database to take advantage of ACID transactions and we talked thorugh how to scale it up and what potential drawbacks would be. For this round just study system design specifically things like sharding, indexing, load-balancing, localization, etc...\\n\\n\\nI was told that I did well on the first round and that they wanted to move on to the onsite interview.\\n\\nOn-site 5 Round Interview:\\n\\nRound 1: Coding Design\\n\\nWas asked to code the snake game. Ask clarifying questions with regards to the input and the outputs of the functions. For this round I did not get much help from the interviewer since she said that everything was my choice. Ended up using a deque to represent the snake body and a map to check for collisions. This question is on leetcode under the atlassian tag so it should be easy to practice.\\n\\nRound 2: DS/Algo\\n\\nGiven a list of votes by seperate judges return the top 3 winners. The first 3 places of the judges votes are given points depending on their place in the judges votes. Don\\'t remeber what I did exactly and how the problem changed, but it is similar to Rank Teams by Votes on leetcode. Was asked about time complexity and if the code is production ready.\\n\\nRound 3: Hiring Manager round\\n\\nWas asked about previous experience and a bunch of behavioral questions. Have you ever recieved negative feedback? Name a time that you wanted to make something for a customer even after facing heavy opposition from team members and team leads?\\n\\nRound 4: System Design Round\\n\\nWas asked to design a system that allowed users to select their favorite colors and share them with friends. Had to decide which type of database to use, the schema, some queries. Was also asked to design the API\\'s as well as describe how it would be called. The discussion continued and we eventually talked about scaling it up, and how to make sure the system was performing as it was supposed to.\\n\\nRound 5: Values interview\\n\\nAsked behavioral questions revolving around Atlassian Values. Just study those and make stories for each of them and you should be fine.\\n\\n\\nResult:\\nWas offered a Junior position with a TC of 170k\\n\\nMore about the offer:\\n121k base\\n37.5k stocks + refreshers\\n12k bonus\\n\\n"
