## 🎯 COMMON QUESTIONS

### **CATEGORY 1: PROJECT LEADERSHIP**

#### **Q1: Tell me about the most complex project you've led.**

**What they're evaluating:**
- Scope/complexity of projects you handle
- Your role in driving success
- How you handle challenges

**Example Answer Structure:**
```
Situation:
- Project: [Name and context]
- Scale: [Team size, timeline, business impact]
- Complexity: [Why it was hard]

Task:
- Your role: [Tech lead, architect, etc.]
- Key responsibilities

Action:
- Planning: How you broke down complexity
- Execution: Key decisions you made
- Challenges: What went wrong, how you adapted
- Stakeholders: How you managed expectations

Result:
- Delivered: [Timeline, scope]
- Impact: [User/business metrics]
- Learning: [What you'd do differently]
```

---

#### **Q2: How do you handle vague or changing requirements?**

**Strong Answer Points:**
- Clarification process with stakeholders
- MVP approach to reduce risk
- Iterative delivery with feedback loops
- Documentation of decisions/assumptions
- Communication strategy when changes happen

**Example:**
"In my last project, we were building a recommendation engine. Initial requirement was simply 'users should see relevant content.' Rather than building in a vacuum:

1. Clarified success metrics: What's 'relevant'? → Defined as CTR >5% and time-on-page >2min
2. Built lightweight prototype in 2 weeks with simple rules-based logic
3. Gathered data & user feedback
4. Iterated with ML-based approach only after proving value

When requirements changed mid-project (pivot from content to product recommendations), we:
- Documented impact analysis: 3 weeks additional work
- Proposed phased delivery: Ship content first, products in v2
- Got stakeholder buy-in before proceeding

Result: Delivered content recommendations on time, products followed 6 weeks later."

### **CATEGORY 2: PEOPLE MANAGEMENT**

#### **Q3: How do you grow junior engineers on your team?**

**Key Areas to Cover:**
- Mentorship approach
- Technical vs soft skills development
- Giving ownership/responsibility
- Feedback mechanisms

**Example:**
"My mentorship philosophy has 3 pillars:

**1. Structured Learning:**
- Pair programming 2x/week on complex features
- Code review with explanations (not just 'change this')
- Weekly 30-min deep-dives on system architecture

**2. Gradual Ownership:**
- Sprint 1: Shadow me on feature design
- Sprint 2: Co-design with my guidance
- Sprint 3: Lead design, I review
- Sprint 4: Full ownership with async check-ins

**3. Psychological Safety:**
- Share my own mistakes openly ('I once took down production by...')
- 'No stupid questions' policy - I ask 'dumb' questions first
- Celebrate learning, not just shipping

**Example:**
Junior engineer Sarah joined, struggled with system design. I:
- Had her document current system (learn by explaining)
- Gave her a small feature end-to-end (ownership)
- Paired on design review (teaching by showing)
- After 6 months, she led design for a major feature independently

Her confidence grew from 'afraid to speak in meetings' to 'explaining architecture to leadership.'"

#### **Q4: Describe a time you gave constructive criticism.**

**Framework:**
- Situation: Performance/quality issue
- Preparation: Specific examples, not vague
- Delivery: Private, empathetic, solution-focused
- Follow-up: Support and track improvement

---

### **CATEGORY 3: TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE**

#### **Q5: How do you ensure code quality on a team with varying skill levels?**

**Strong Answer:**
"Multi-layered approach:

**1. Preventive (Build Quality In):**
- Coding standards documented in wiki
- Linters/formatters in pre-commit hooks
- Architecture decision records (ADRs) for big decisions

**2. Detective (Catch Issues Early):**
- Mandatory code reviews (2 approvals for critical paths)
- Automated testing: 80% coverage minimum
- Sonar/CodeClimate for static analysis

**3. Supportive (Help People Improve):**
- Code review guidelines: 'Explain WHY, not just WHAT'
- Weekly tech talks: Seniors share patterns
- Pair programming budget: 4 hours/week for juniors

**4. Culture:**
- 'Beginner's mind' retrospectives: What's confusing about our code?
- Refactoring sprints: 20% time for tech debt
- Blameless post-mortems: Learn from incidents

**Metrics I track:**
- PR cycle time (goal: <24hrs)
- Review comments per PR (sweet spot: 3-5)
- Production incidents (trend down over time)

**Example:**
Team had 8 engineers (2 senior, 6 mid/junior). Code quality was inconsistent. After implementing above:
- Test coverage: 40% → 82% in 6 months
- Production bugs: 15/month → 3/month
- PR turnaround: 2-3 days → same-day
- Junior engineers started catching senior engineers' bugs!"

#### **Q6: How do you prioritize technical debt vs new features?**

**Framework:**
- Quantify tech debt impact (velocity, bugs, morale)
- Make business case (not just 'code is messy')
- Allocate percentage (e.g., 20% sprint capacity)
- Track ROI of tech debt work

**Example:**
"I use a 'Tech Debt Tax' model:

**Step 1: Quantify:**
- Tracked that legacy auth system caused:
  * 40% of our production incidents
  * 3 hours/week of engineer time debugging
  * Blocked 2 new features due to coupling

**Step 2: Business Case to PM:**
- 'Refactoring auth will cost 4 sprint weeks'
- 'But save 12 hours/month ongoing (144 hours/year = $50K)'
- 'Plus unblock 2 features worth $500K ARR'
- ROI is clear

**Step 3: Execution:**
- 70/30 rule: 70% features, 30% tech debt
- Tech debt visible on roadmap (not shadow work)
- Celebrate tech debt wins like feature launches

**Result:**
- Refactored auth system over 3 months
- Production incidents dropped 60%
- Team velocity increased 25% (less firefighting)
- PM became advocate for tech debt time"

### **CATEGORY 4: CAREER & MOTIVATION**

#### **Q7: Why are you looking to leave your current company?**

**⚠️ BE CAREFUL: Don't bash current employer!**

**Good Answers (Focus on PULL, not PUSH):**
- "Seeking bigger scale/impact"
- "Want to work on [specific domain/tech] that Atlassian does well"
- "Growth opportunities align with my career goals"

**Avoid:**
- ❌ "My manager sucks"
- ❌ "Politics / bureaucracy"
- ❌ "Underpaid" (only discuss comp if asked)

**Example:**
"I've grown a lot at Current Company - learned [X, Y, Z]. However, I'm looking for:

1. **Greater Technical Challenge:**
   - Currently working with 10K users; want to operate at 10M+ scale
   - Atlassian's distributed systems work excites me

2. **Broader Impact:**
   - Want to influence product direction, not just execution
   - P50 role offers that scope

3. **Team/Culture:**
   - Atlassian's 'Open Company, No Bullshit' resonates with my values
   - Heard great things from [friend who works there]

I'm grateful for my current role, but ready for the next level of challenge."

---

#### **Q8: Where do you see yourself in 5 years?**

**What they want to hear:**
- Alignment with career ladder (IC vs management)
- Ambition but grounded
- Interest in Atlassian specifically

**Example (IC track):**
"In 5 years, I see myself as a Staff/Principal Engineer (IC track):

**Technical Leadership:**
- Architecting large-scale distributed systems
- Mentoring senior engineers
- Setting technical direction for a product area

**Staying hands-on:**
- I love coding and want to remain close to the code
- But influencing more broadly through design, mentorship, standards

**Why Atlassian aligns:**
- Your IC track goes to Principal+ (some companies force management)
- Work on products I use daily (Jira, Confluence)
- Opportunity to work on different products over time

**Flexibility:**
- Open to management if it's the right fit
- But currently energized by deep technical problems"

---

#### **Q9: What's your management style? (If applying for EM role)**

**Framework:**
- Servant leadership
- Empower, don't micromanage
- Clear expectations + trust
- Regular feedback, not just reviews

**Example:**
"My management philosophy: 'Set direction, remove obstacles, celebrate wins.'

**1. Clear Goals:**
- OKRs at team and individual level
- Weekly 1:1s to track progress and unblock

**2. Autonomy:**
- I don't prescribe HOW, only WHAT and WHY
- Juniors get more structure; seniors get more freedom

**3. Growth:**
- Career development plans (updated quarterly)
- Sponsorship: I advocate for promotions actively

**4. Feedback:**
- Weekly 1:1s include feedback (not just project updates)
- 360 reviews: I ask my team to review ME

**Example:**
As manager of 6 engineers:
- 2 promoted in 12 months
- Retention: 100% over 2 years
- Team NPS: 9/10 in engagement surveys

**My weakness:**
- Sometimes I jump in to solve problems myself (engineering background)
- Working on coaching more, solving less"
