# 🐍 Python-First Code Design Files

All Code_Design problem files have been reorganized to prioritize **Python implementations**.

## Structure:
1. **Primary Implementation: Python** (detailed, production-ready)
2. **Alternative Implementation: Java** (reference at end of file)

This matches industry trends where Python is increasingly used for:
- System design discussions
- Rapid prototyping
- Interview coding (cleaner syntax)
- Backend services at modern companies

Java implementations remain available for reference at the end of each file.
