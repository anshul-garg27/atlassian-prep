# 🐍 Python-First Implementation Guide

## Why Python-First?

All Code_Design problems are now **Python-first** because:

### ✅ **Interview Advantages**
1. **Cleaner syntax** - Less boilerplate, focus on logic
2. **Faster to code** - Implement more in limited time
3. **Built-in data structures** - defaultdict, deque, Counter
4. **Industry trend** - Many companies moving to Python for backend
5. **Easier to explain** - Readable code = better communication

### ✅ **Atlassian Context**
- Atlassian uses **Python for automation and tooling**
- Their API SDKs support Python
- Internal tools often Python-based
- Shows modern tech stack knowledge

### 📝 **File Structure**
Each problem file follows this structure:

```markdown
# Problem Title

## Problem Statement
(Same for all languages)

## Visual Examples
(Same for all languages)

## 💻 Python Implementation (PRIMARY)
✅ Full implementation with:
- Type hints
- Dataclasses
- Modern Python 3.10+ features
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Clean, production-ready code

## Extensions & Follow-ups
(Python examples)

## Testing Strategy
(Python unit tests)

## 🔧 Alternative: Java Implementation (REFERENCE)
(Java version for reference at end)
```

### 🚀 **Quick Reference**

| Problem | Python Focus | Why |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Rate Limiter | Token Bucket with threading | Shows concurrency in Python |
| Snake Game | Dataclasses + deque | Clean OOP design |
| Trello Board | Type hints + composition | Modern Python patterns |
| Tagging System | defaultdict + sets | Pythonic data structures |
| Voting System | Strategy pattern | Design patterns in Python |

### 💡 **Interview Pro Tips**

**When to mention Python:**
- "I'm using Python for cleaner syntax and faster implementation"
- "Python's built-in collections make this more concise"
- "I can translate this to Java if needed" (show flexibility)

**When interviewer prefers Java:**
- "I can implement this in Java as well" (adapt to requirement)
- Most problems have Java versions at end for reference
- Core logic remains the same

---

**Bottom Line:** Python-first approach is modern, efficient, and increasingly preferred in interviews. Java remains available for reference.
