# 📝 PROBLEM 10: WORD WRAP / TEXT JUSTIFICATION

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Format Text with Line Length Constraints**

**Frequency:** Medium-High (Appears in ~30-35% of rounds)
**Difficulty:** Medium-Hard
**Similar to:** [LeetCode 68 - Text Justification](https://leetcode.com/problems/text-justification/)

---

## 📋 Problem Statement

Given a list of `words` and a `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has **exactly** `maxWidth` characters and is fully justified (except the last line).

**Justification Rules:**
1. **Pack Greedily:** Fit as many words as possible per line
2. **Distribute Spaces:** Pad extra spaces evenly between words
3. **Left-Heavy Distribution:** If spaces don't divide evenly, assign more to left gaps
4. **Last Line:** Left-justified only (single space between words, pad end with spaces)

**Constraints:**
- 1 ≤ words.length ≤ 300
- 1 ≤ words[i].length ≤ maxWidth
- 1 ≤ maxWidth ≤ 100
- Words consist of non-space characters only

## 🎨 Visual Example

### Example 1: Even Space Distribution

```text
Words: ["What", "must", "be", "acknowledgment", "shall", "be"]
maxWidth: 16

Line 1: "What   must   be"
         W h a t ███ m u s t ███ b e
         4 chars + 4 chars + 2 chars = 10 letters
         16 - 10 = 6 spaces → 2 gaps → 3 spaces each

Line 2: "acknowledgment  "
         (Single word, left-justify, pad end)
         14 chars + 2 spaces = 16

Line 3: "shall be        "
         (Last line, left-justify)
         5 + 1 + 2 + 8 spaces = 16
```

### Example 2: Uneven Space Distribution

```text
Words: ["This", "is", "an", "example"]
maxWidth: 16

Line 1: "This    is    an"
         T h i s ████ i s ████ a n
         4 + 2 + 2 = 8 letters
         16 - 8 = 8 spaces → 2 gaps → 4 spaces each

Line 2: "example         "
         (Last line, left-justify)
         7 + 9 spaces = 16
```

### Example 3: Left-Heavy Distribution

```text
Words: ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
maxWidth: 7

Line 1: "a  b  c"
         1 + 1 + 1 = 3 letters
         7 - 3 = 4 spaces → 2 gaps
         4 ÷ 2 = 2 spaces per gap, 0 remainder
         Result: 2, 2

Line 2: "d  e   "
         (Last line, left-justify)
```

---

## 💡 Examples

### Example 1: Standard Text
```python
words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
result = fullJustify(words, 16)

for line in result:
    print(f"|{line}|")
    
# Output:
# |This    is    an|
# |example  of text|
# |justification.  |
```

### Example 2: Single Long Word
```python
words = ["verylongword"]
result = fullJustify(words, 20)
# |verylongword        |
```

## 🗣️ Interview Conversation Guide

### Phase 1: Clarification (3-5 min)

**Candidate:** "Can a single word be longer than `maxWidth`?"
**Interviewer:** "No, guaranteed that `word.length ≤ maxWidth`."

**Candidate:** "For the last line, should it be left-justified with spaces padded to the right?"
**Interviewer:** "Yes, single space between words, remaining spaces on the right."

**Candidate:** "If a line has only one word (not the last line), how should it be formatted?"
**Interviewer:** "Treat it like the last line—left-justified with spaces on the right."

**Candidate:** "How should we count the minimum space required? Is it word lengths plus one space between each word?"
**Interviewer:** "Yes, you need at least `sum(word lengths) + (num_words - 1)` characters."

### Phase 2: Approach Discussion (5-8 min)

**Candidate:** "This is a **Greedy Line Packing** problem with careful space distribution.

**Algorithm:**
1. **Packing Phase (Greedy):**
   - For each line, greedily pack words until adding the next word would exceed `maxWidth`.
   - Account for mandatory spaces between words.

2. **Formatting Phase:**
   - Calculate total spaces needed: `maxWidth - sum(word_lengths)`.
   - **Case A (Last line or single word):** Left-justify.
   - **Case B (Normal line):** Distribute spaces evenly across gaps.
     - Base spaces per gap: `total_spaces // num_gaps`.
     - Extra spaces: `total_spaces % num_gaps`.
     - Assign extra spaces to leftmost gaps (left-heavy distribution).

**Complexity:** O(N) where N = total characters in all words."

### Phase 3: Implementation (15-20 min)

**Candidate:** "I'll implement this with careful index management and a helper function for formatting lines."

---

## 🧠 Intuition & Approach

### Why Greedy?

**Observation:** To minimize total lines and maximize readability, we want to fit as many words as possible per line. Greedy packing achieves this.

### Space Distribution Logic

```text
Example: 3 words, 10 total spaces, 2 gaps

Base distribution: 10 ÷ 2 = 5 spaces per gap, 0 remainder
Result: [5, 5]

Example: 3 words, 11 total spaces, 2 gaps

Base: 11 ÷ 2 = 5 spaces per gap, 1 remainder
Left-heavy: First gap gets +1
Result: [6, 5]

Example: 4 words, 10 total spaces, 3 gaps

Base: 10 ÷ 3 = 3 spaces per gap, 1 remainder
Left-heavy: First gap gets +1
Result: [4, 3, 3]
```

## 🔍 Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity: **O(N)**

Where N = total number of characters in all words.
- **Packing:** Each word is visited once → O(W) where W = number of words.
- **Formatting:** Each character is written once → O(N).
- **Total:** O(N).

### Space Complexity: **O(1)**

Excluding the output array. We only use constant extra space for loop variables and counters.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

### 1. **Off-by-One in Space Calculation**

**Wrong:**
```python
# Forgetting that first word doesn't need a leading space
new_length = line_length + 1 + len(word)  # ❌ Always adds space
```

**Right:**
```python
needed_space = 1 if line_words else 0
new_length = line_length + needed_space + len(word)
```

### 2. **Incorrect Gap Count**

**Wrong:**
```python
num_gaps = num_words  # ❌ 3 words have 2 gaps, not 3
```

**Right:**
```python
num_gaps = num_words - 1
```

### 3. **Not Handling Last Line Specially**

**Wrong:**
```python
# Always fully justify
line = distribute_spaces(line_words, total_spaces)
```

**Problem:** Last line should be left-justified.

**Right:** Check `if j == n` (reached end).

### 4. **Wrong Extra Space Distribution**

**Wrong:**
```python
# Distributing extra spaces to rightmost gaps
for k in range(extra_spaces):
    spaces_array[-(k+1)] += 1  # ❌ Right-heavy
```

**Right:** Distribute to **leftmost** gaps.
```python
spaces = spaces_per_gap + (1 if k < extra_spaces else 0)
```

## 🔄 Follow-up Questions

### Follow-up 1: Minimize Raggedness (DP Approach)

**Problem Statement:**
> "Instead of greedy packing, choose line breaks to minimize the sum of squared 'badness' of each line, where badness = (unused_spaces)². This is how TeX/LaTeX does it."

**Solution: Dynamic Programming**

```python
def word_wrap_dp(words: List[str], maxWidth: int) -> float:
    """
    Find minimum cost line breaks using DP.
    Cost = sum of (spaces_remaining)^2 for each line.
    
    Returns minimum cost (not the actual formatting).
    """
    n = len(words)
    INF = float('inf')
    
    # Precompute: can words[i..j] fit on one line?
    # And what's the cost?
    fits = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    cost = [[INF] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    for i in range(n):
        length = 0
        for j in range(i, n):
            length += len(words[j])
            if j > i:
                length += 1  # Space between words
            
            if length <= maxWidth:
                fits[i][j] = True
                spaces = maxWidth - length
                cost[i][j] = spaces * spaces
    
    # DP: dp[i] = min cost to format words[i:]
    dp = [INF] * (n + 1)
    dp[n] = 0  # Base case: no words left
    
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if fits[i][j]:
                # Try breaking after word j
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], cost[i][j] + dp[j + 1])
    
    return dp[0]

### Follow-up 2: HTML/Markdown Rendering

**Problem Statement:**
> "Words may contain special formatting like `**bold**`. Don't break words, but do count formatting characters toward line length."

**Solution:**
Treat each word as an atomic unit (don't split). Count full length including markup.

```python
def justify_with_markup(words: List[str], maxWidth: int) -> List[str]:
    """
    Justify text with markup (e.g., **bold**).
    Markup characters count toward maxWidth.
    """
    # Use same algorithm, but len(word) includes markup
    return fullJustify(words, maxWidth)

# Example:
words_with_markup = ["This", "is", "**bold**", "text"]
result = justify_with_markup(words_with_markup, 20)
```

---

### Follow-up 3: Right-Justified or Centered

**Problem Statement:**
> "Implement variants: right-justified (spaces on left) or centered (spaces evenly distributed left and right)."

**Solution:**

```python
def right_justify(words: List[str], maxWidth: int) -> List[str]:
    """
    Right-justify text (spaces on the left).
    """
    result = []
    for word in words:
        spaces = maxWidth - len(word)
        result.append(" " * spaces + word)
    return result

def center_justify(words: List[str], maxWidth: int) -> List[str]:
    """
    Center-justify text.
    """
    result = []
    for word in words:
        spaces = maxWidth - len(word)
        left_spaces = spaces // 2
        right_spaces = spaces - left_spaces
        result.append(" " * left_spaces + word + " " * right_spaces)
    return result
```

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. **Greedy Packing** works for this variant (maximize words per line).
2. **Space Distribution** is the tricky part (division with remainder).
3. **Edge Cases** matter: last line, single word, exact fit.
4. **DP Variant** minimizes raggedness (more complex, O(N²)).
5. **Index Management** requires careful attention to avoid off-by-one errors.
