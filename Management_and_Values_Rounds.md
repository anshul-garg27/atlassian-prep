# Management & Values Rounds - Atlassian Interview Guide

This document covers the Management and Values rounds, which are **mandatory for Senior Engineer (P40+) roles** and are as important as technical rounds. Many candidates fail here despite acing technical rounds.

---

## Overview

### Importance
*   **Mandatory for Senior+ Roles:** You MUST clear these rounds even if you ace all technical rounds
*   **Downleveling Risk:** Poor performance can result in downgrading from P50 to P40
*   **Equal Weight:** These rounds carry the same weight as DSA/LLD/HLD rounds
*   **Also for Interns:** Even intern candidates have a Managerial/Values round (combined, 40-45 minutes)

### Round Structure
*   **Round 4:** Management Round (interviewer will be a manager)
*   **Round 5:** Values Round (focused on Atlassian's 5 core values)
*   Both rounds are entirely behavioral (no technical questions)

---

## Management Round

### What Interviewers Look For
*   Leadership experience (even if you're an IC)
*   Impact on team and projects
*   Ability to mentor and influence others
*   Decision-making and conflict resolution
*   Cross-team collaboration

### Common Questions
1.  **Leadership & Initiative:**
    *   "Did you ever take initiative to improve the current system in your team?"
    *   "Tell me about a time when you led a project without a formal leadership role."

2.  **Team Dynamics:**
    *   "Did you ever put your team ahead of your personal goals?"
    *   "How did you handle a situation where a teammate's performance was affecting the team?"

3.  **Technical Disagreements:**
    *   "Did you ever oppose someone's technical approach? How did you handle it?"
    *   "Tell me about a time when you convinced other teams to align with your thought process."

4.  **Challenges & Failures:**
    *   "What was the most challenging task you have faced?"
    *   "Did you ever commit to something and were not able to deliver it on time?"
    *   "Did you drive any change in the team which ultimately got rejected?"

5.  **Impact & Ownership:**
    *   "Describe a project where you individually had a major impact."
    *   "How did you improve someone's performance?"

### Preparation Strategy

#### If You Lack Managerial Experience
**Don't admit it!** Even as an IC (Individual Contributor), you can frame your experiences to show leadership:

**Bad Response:**
> "I helped my colleague learn a new technology."

**Good Response:**
> "My colleague was newly promoted to a Senior role and was struggling with resource management and progress tracking. I coached him on best practices I learned from my experience, such as setting up dedicated project calls outside of daily standups to thoroughly assess progress, using JIRA more effectively for sprint planning, and implementing a code review checklist. This improved his velocity by 30% and his team's delivery predictability."

#### STAR Format
Every answer should follow the **STAR format**:
*   **S**ituation: Set the context
*   **T**ask: Describe the challenge
*   **A**ction: Explain what YOU did (focus on your actions)
*   **R**esult: Quantify the impact (numbers, metrics, outcomes)

#### Prepare Multiple Examples
*   Have 5-7 stories prepared covering different scenarios
*   Each story should highlight different skills (leadership, conflict resolution, mentoring, technical decision-making)
*   Ensure stories show **individual impact**, not just team success

## Values Round

### Atlassian's 5 Core Values
Atlassian has 5 core values, and interviewers ask questions directly based on these. You MUST prepare a story for each value.

**Official Resource:**
> URL: `https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/values-interviewing-atlassian.pdf`

This PDF contains:
*   Definitions of all 5 values
*   2 sample questions for each value
*   What interviewers look for in responses

### The 5 Values (General Framework)
While the specific values may evolve, they generally include themes like:
1.  **Open Company, No Bullshit:** Transparency, honesty, direct communication
2.  **Build with Heart and Balance:** Customer empathy, work-life balance
3.  **Don't #@!% the Customer:** Customer-centric decisions
4.  **Play, As a Team:** Collaboration, team success over individual glory
5.  **Be the Change You Seek:** Taking initiative, driving change

### Common Questions (Values Round)
1.  "Tell me about a time when you were transparent about a mistake."
2.  "Describe a situation where you prioritized customer needs over business goals."
3.  "Have you ever challenged a decision that didn't align with your values?"
4.  "Tell me about a time when you helped a teammate succeed."
5.  "What's the biggest challenge you faced in your career, and how did you overcome it?"

### Questions for Interns / Junior Candidates (Adapted)
Since interns may not have work experience, questions are adapted to college/project scenarios:
1.  "Do you believe in sharing your knowledge? Give an example from college."
2.  "Tell me about a time when someone made a decision for you that you disagreed with. What did you do?"
3.  "Describe your biggest achievement in college."
4.  "Have you worked in a team project? What was your role and impact?"
5.  "Tell me about a challenging situation you faced in college and how you overcame it."

### Preparation Strategy

#### Read the Official PDF
*   Download the Atlassian values PDF (URL mentioned above)
*   Understand the intent behind each value
*   Map your experiences to each value

#### Use STAR Format (Again)
*   Responses must be structured and concise
*   Avoid rambling; get to the point

#### Be Authentic
*   Interviewers can detect rehearsed or fake stories
*   Use real experiences, even if they seem small
*   Show vulnerability (admitting mistakes, learning from failures)

#### Avoid These Pitfalls
*   **Vague Answers:** "I always work well with my team" (too generic)
*   **No Metrics:** Quantify impact wherever possible
*   **Blaming Others:** Focus on your actions, not others' failures
*   **Overconfidence:** Balance confidence with humility

## Key Differences: Management vs. Values Round

| Aspect | Management Round | Values Round |
|--------|------------------|--------------|
| **Focus** | Leadership, impact, decision-making | Alignment with Atlassian culture |
| **Interviewer** | Manager/Team Lead | Senior IC or Manager |
| **Questions** | Project impact, team dynamics | Values-based scenarios |
| **Overlap** | ~50% overlap in questions | ~50% overlap in questions |
| **Preparation** | Focus on "how you lead" | Focus on "why you made that choice" |

## Common Feedback from Rejected Candidates

### Why Candidates Fail
1.  **Went Unprepared:** Assumed these rounds are "just formalities"
2.  **Lack of Structure:** Answers were rambling and lacked STAR format
3.  **No Quantifiable Impact:** Could not demonstrate measurable outcomes
4.  **Weak Leadership Examples:** Only talked about being a "team member" rather than driving change
5.  **Cultural Misfit:** Answers showed misalignment with Atlassian values (e.g., overly competitive, not team-oriented)

### Candidate Quotes
> "I expected a mix of technical and behavioral questions, but it was entirely behavioral. The interviewer expected STAR format answers, and I felt I didn't perform well."

> "Don't take 5th and 6th rounds lightly, they are as important as the technical rounds, especially if it is P50 and above. Go prepared with good amount of examples."

> "The main rejection came from the managerial round, but I was approved in the values round."

## Final Tips

1.  **Practice Out Loud:** Rehearse your stories; don't just think through them.

3.  **Show Vulnerability:** It's okay to talk about failures if you learned from them.

**What This Means:**
*   Emphasis on practical problem-solving over algorithm tricks.
*   Expect questions like "Design a file system" not "Find Kth smallest in BST."
*   Code must be production-ready, not just correct.
