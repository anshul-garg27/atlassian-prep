Given that load is equally distributed on all servers.\r\nDo you see any concern with this architecture ?\r\n\r\nQ2:\r\nGiven an crossword puzzle gaming application which is giving hints to user, what are the advantages and disadvantages of both following approaches:\r\n-fetching hints from server\r\n-preloading hints on device\r\n\r\nQ3:\r\nGiven a large XML file having lot of data to be processed by a service. Default hardware doesn't have enough RAM to hold entire file.\r\nGive some approaches to optiise it.\r\n\r\nQ4:\r\nGiven a smart engine service which takes URLs from user and process out some useful data from it. You have to plan the budget of this project. What things you will take into consideration.\r\nExpectations were basically, what things you will ask client to figure out capacity estimation parameters.\r\n\r\nQ5:\r\nGiven a social media app for college students, successfully running in US. How you will scale it to release worldwide.\r\n\r\n\r\nDSA1:\r\nWord-wrap : Given a list of strings and an integer maxLen. You have to wrap the words in to lines(which will be another string) '-' separated.\r\nIf line length is exceeding maxLen, start new Line.\r\ne.g. \r\nI/P : [\"Hello\", \"Sir\", \"Please\", \"Upvote\", \"If\", \"You\", \"Like\", \"My\", \"Post\"], maxLen=10\r\n\r\nO/P : [\"Hello-Sir\", \"Please\", \"Upvote-If\", \"You-Like\", \"My-Post\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nDSA2: Another variation of above problem.\r\nGiven a list of sentences (string having words separated by space), and an integer exactLen.\r\nYou have to generate line of exactLen (Similar to above question), by rearranging the words in above sentences but keep order maintained. If lineLength is less than exactLen, fill it with '-' which should be distributed equally from left to right.\r\nLast line does not need to have additional '-'\r\ne.g.\r\nI/P : [ \"The day began as still as the\", \"night abruptly lighted with\", \"brilliant flame\" ], exactLen=24\r\n\r\nO/P : \r\n[ \r\n\"The--day--began-as-still\",\r\n\"as--the--night--abruptly\",\r\n\"lighted--with--brilliant\",\r\n\"flame\" ] // <--- a single word on a line is not padded with spaces\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWas able to answer some system design questions properly, and some were bit challenging.\r\nImplemented DSA1 completly and passed all unit tests.\r\nExplained solution of second, without starting the code as calls needs to be closed in 60 min.\r\nInterview seems happy with DSA and couple of system design problems,and okayish rest system design questions.\r\n\r\nHardest thing I faced in this round was time management.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPS : Next week Amazon's onboarding is scheduled and had this round in last week of notice period so didn't think of re-do chance.\r\n\r\nPlease comment your thoughts if re-do opportunity should have been considered ?\r\n\r\n",

Working solution was required and I had construct the dependency graph as well. The starting point was company which had multiple departments and in the deparments, there were multiple employees.\\nI gave the Lowest Common Ancestor approach and ran the solution for multiple test cases. The verdict was NO Hire. The reasons provided from the HR -\\na. No clarifying questions were asked.\\nb. The edge cases like - if the employee didn\\'t exist wasn\\'t covered. (I had a discussion with the interviewer on this specifically and implemented the fail safe)\\nc. Time complexity wasn\\'t computed correctly.\\nPS - To make the approach more efficient, I proposed to store the paths from the root to the deparments and just check which deparment the employee belongs to while getting the closest department. But the interviewer didn\\'t let me discuss on this approach and kept insisting on making the LCA approach better without sheding any light on what exactly he felt the issue was.(space or time?)\\nPlease write in the comments if you have a better solution.\\n\\n\\nHLD Round - Atlassian Tags management.\\nThe interviewer was a Principal engineer and maturely handled the interview. Asked the API design, DB schema, microservices and then moved on to discussion on scaled up system. He asked questions on which components can act as a bottleneck and how can they be scaled.\\nThe verdict was positive.\\n\\n\\nLLD Round - Mobile Snake system design\\nI was a bit overwhelmed because i hadn\\'t attempted this question before and there were multiple requirements that were needed to be implemented. Finally, the interviewer wanted to see the position of head and tail in the console. I gave a working solution and was able to run all the use cases which were asked.\\n\\n\\nThe verdict was NO Hire. The reasons provided from the HR -\\na. Unit Test cases were not written\\nb. Exception handling wasn\\'t done.\\nc. corner cases weren\\'t covered\\n\\n\\nPS - I was proud of myself after implementing a running solution. But the HR feedback was absurd.\\n\\nWhat do you guys think?\\nHope I will be able to help others planning to give Atlassian interviews.",

      "content": "\r\nHey everyone 👋,\r\n\r\nI wanted to share something I realized after grinding **200+ LeetCode problems** over the last few months while preparing for product-based company interviews (Amazon, Atlassian, Microsoft, etc.).\r\n\r\nFor the longest time, I thought solving more problems = getting better.\r\nBut after multiple OAs and interviews, I hit a strange wall — I could *code* every known pattern but still *froze* when faced with a slightly twisted variation.\r\n\r\nThen it clicked:\r\n\r\n> I wasn’t learning **how to think**, I was just learning **how to recall**.\r\n\r\nOnce I changed my approach, everything shifted.\r\n\r\nHere’s what actually helped me break the plateau:\r\n\r\n1. 🚧 **Stopped chasing problem count** — started mastering patterns instead.\r\n2. 🧠 **Explained every problem aloud** (as if teaching it) — made logic stick deeper.\r\n3. 🧩 **Re-solved problems after 3–4 days without looking** — forced true recall.\r\n4. ⚙️ **Grouped problems by concept (Recursion → DP → Graph)** — built connected intuition.\r\n5. 💬 **Started writing summaries** of what I *learned*, not what I *coded*.\r\n\r\nAfter this mindset shift, even tough DP and graph problems started to feel more “predictable.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 🔍 What I’m Curious About\r\n\r\nFor everyone who’s been at this for a while —\r\n**What was the “aha moment” that made DSA finally click for you?**\r\nWas it a pattern, a resource, or a habit that changed how you think?\r\n\r\nWould love to hear your frameworks, mistakes, and mental models — might help a lot of us who are still somewhere in the grind phase. 💪\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*(P.S. If this resonates, I’m planning to share a “pattern-based DSA roadmap” I made for myself — covering 14 problem archetypes across DP, graphs, and recursion. Should I post it?)*\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "content": "### **Background**\n\n* **Education:** Tier-3\n* **Experience:** 5 Years (3 Years in FAANG)\n* **Designation:** SE-2\n* **Current Company:** Startup\n\n---\n\n### **Interview Experience**\n\nI applied to multiple SDE2 openings on **the** portal. I got **a** call from a recruiter. I'll consider the recruiter contact day as Day 0.\n\n#### Day 1 : Karat Interview (1 hr)\n\n##### System design Questions\n\n1.) We are working on a clone of Facebook. We want to add a numeric count to every post showing how many friends the post's author has at the time of viewing the post. The database schema looks like this:\n**USER**\n* `user_id` (primary key)\n* `name`\n* `created_date`\n\n**USER RELATIONSHIP**\n* `friendship_id` (primary key, unique to each relationship)\n* `user_id` (indexed)\n* `user2_id` (indexed)\n* `start_date`\n\nFocusing on the database, how would you implement the friend-count feature? Note that we will soon be more popular than Facebook, so the solution needs to scale.\n\n2.) We are working on a clone of Google Docs. The software has the following features and limitations:\n* Multiple users may work on a single document at the same time.\n* A document must be handled by a single server, no matter how many users **there are**.\n* We have a fixed number of servers which will be sufficient to handle our **expected load** properly.\n\nOur load balancer uses a round-robin system to permanently assign documents to each server, so **that** each will have an equal number of documents. Do you have any concerns about this load **balancing** system? In those cases, how would you fix the **scalability issue**?\n\n3.) Which consistency model is more appropriate for each of these applications: **strong** or **eventual** consistency? Why?\n* An API call that needs to respond within 20 milliseconds, used to retrieve **video stream metadata**. The metadata includes things like the author name, rating, and **view count**.\n* A web analytics platform recording every single click on a popular web page.\n* A banking system that makes deposits and payments to checking accounts.\n\n4.) **Another scenario was that** there was a bug on an application, and you ended up having a lot of failed requests. You have a database that stores all IDs, and you also have large log files from about 500 different production servers that log the IDs of the successful requests. How would you come up with a solution to find the IDs that were missing?\n\n##### Coding Question\nThe question was similar to [68. Text Justification](https://leetcode.com/problems/text-justification/description/) and had one **follow-up**. I was able to fully solve the question and **gave my** approach for the **follow-up**.\n\n---\n\n#### Day 6 : Data Structures Interview (1 hr)\n\nYou have `N` services **in** a network. You are given which servers are connected and the connection latency. For example `[1, 2, 200]` means service `1` calls service `2` and it has a latency of 200ms. You are given `Q` queries where you have to output the minimum latency from Service `X` to Service `Y`.\n\n**The** interviewer wanted to discuss why classic DFS and BFS should not be the solution, how **Dijkstra's** algorithm **would** work, **what the** other ways **are** to solve this, and **the** time complexity.\n\nIn the end, I provided the solution using **Dijkstra's** algorithm.\n\n**Rating:** Hire (Medium confidence)\n\n---\n\n#### Day 7 : Code Design Interview (1 hr)\n\n**Customer Satisfaction**\n\na) Imagine we have a customer support ticketing system. The system allows customers to rate the support agent out of 5. To start with, write a function which accepts a rating, and another which will show me all of the agents and the average rating **each** one has received, ordered from highest to lowest.\nc) Now I want to be able to see who the best agents are each month. Change the implementation so I can get that information.\n\nI **followed the** `Test-Driven Development (TDD)` approach as mentioned by the recruiter in the preparation guide. Atlassian recruiters are really helpful.\n\n**Rating:** Hire (Medium confidence)\n\n---\n\n#### Day 13 : System Design Interview (1 hr)\n\n**Question: Tagging Management Service**\n\nAtlassian has a number of different products, each containing different types of content. As an example, let’s look at three of our products:\n\n* Jira – Issues\n* Confluence – Pages\n* Bitbucket – Pull requests\n\nWe want to build a system that allows users to tag content from different products, and then to view content by tags. A goal of this system is that it should be built **in** a product-agnostic way so that we could add new products in the future without a large amount of work. There are three key experiences that we want to build here:\n\n* As a user, I can add, remove, and update tags on content.\n* As a user, I can click on a tag and see all content that has been associated with that tag.\n* As a user, I can see a dashboard of popular tags.\n\n**The** recruiter focused on API Specification, DB Schema, DB Choice (SQL/NoSQL), Communication protocols, SQS vs **RabbitMQ** vs Kafka, **and** Rate **limiting**.\n\n**Rating:** Hire (Low confidence)\n\nThe recruiter mentioned the reason for the \"low confidence hire\" was that the **interviewer** felt the design was a little rushed.\n\n---\n\n#### Day 16 : Managerial Interview (1 hr)\n\n**This involved** standard managerial-type **questions** based on my previous work experiences.\n\n**Rating:** Hire (High confidence)\n\n---\n\n#### Day 20 : Values Interview (45 mins)\n\n**The questions were similar to those mentioned** in the following LeetCode article:\n[[Disclosed] Atlassian Full Loop Question [SSE & SDE 2]](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6974858/disclosed-atlassian-full-loop-question-b-ulje/)\n\n**Rating:** Hire (High confidence)\n\n---\n\n##### Day 31 : **Got** confirmation about the HC Result\n##### Day 35 : **The** recruiter scheduled a team matching meeting\n##### Day 38 : **I had the** team matching call\n##### Day 41 : **I received the offer**\n\n---\n\n##### Compensation:\n[Atlassian | P40 | India [Accepted]](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/7069410/atlassian-p40-india-accepted-by-anonymou-p3qh/)\n\n---\n\n##### Remarks\nHere are my thoughts on my recent 6-month job search:\n\n* **The Market:** It's tough out there. Interviews are hard, and there is little room for mistakes.\n* **My Journey:** It was a long road. I was rejected by many companies like Apple, Dream11, Microsoft (2 times), Arcesium, Myntra, Tekion, Google, Salesforce (Ghosted), and Uber (Ghosted) before I finally got offers from Microsoft and Atlassian.\n* **What Helped:** My previous experience at a FAANG company made my resume stand out and helped me get more calls for interviews.\n* **My Advice:** Just keep going. Don't let the rejections discourage you. Keep interviewing, and you will find the right job.",

Since then, I've been actively interviewing with multiple companies. The job market has definitely tightened — hiring has become slower, interview loops are more stringent, and ghosting by recruiters is more common than ever, even after positive feedback.\n\nThat being said — don’t lose hope. Keep grinding, keep preparing. Your break will come. \n\nHere’s a quick snapshot of my journey:\n\n**Companies Interviewed:**\nLinkedIn, Salesforce, Atlassian, Oracle, Deliveroo, Uber, and a few startups.\n\n**Ghosted After Good Feedback :**\nUber, Salesforce, LinkedIn — frustrating, but part of the game now.\n\n\n\n**Profile Snapshot:**\nYOE: 7.5 (Product-Based Companies)\n\nRole: Lead Software Engineer (Backend + Full Stack)\n\nPrevious Org: US-Based Tech Company\n\n\n**Previous Compensation:**\n- Base: ₹60L\n- Variable: 10% (~₹6L)\n- Equity: N/A\n- **Total CTC**: **₹66L**\n\n**Offer from Atlassian**\n- Role Type: Fully Remote\n- Level: P40 (Note: Originally evaluated for P50 but like everyone else, got downleveled - they do this)\n- Base: ₹60L\n- Bonus: 15% (~₹9L)\n- Equity: USD 80K over 4 years-> $20K/year -> Approx. ~₹17L/year\n- Sign-On Bonus: ₹6L\n\n🔹 **Total 1st Year Compensation:** **₹92L**\n🔹 Total Compensation (from Year 2): ₹86L\n\n\n\nI feel like I got lowballed on overall equity offered, but i still feel satisfied with the overall comp and the opportunity. \n\nWill soon share interview experience and preparation strategy used and update this post.

Any concerns ?\\n(Follow-up: How would you improve this system ?)\\n2. What are the estimation required in next 6 months for a system which accepts web URLS from users, parses them and derives information using machine learning models ?\\n3. How to handle a large file that cannot fit on a single machine ?\\n4. What changes would you make to the system when your app is going from single country to multiple countries internationally ?\\n5. What are advantages and disadvantages of pre-loading hints vs loading from the server for a puzzle game ?\\n\\nProblem Solving (DSA): (30 minutes, Medium level questions)\\n1. Given a board with numbers from 0 to lastNumber, startPosition, teleporters like. (\"3,1\", \"5,10\", \"8,2\") and maxValue of a die. Also, if after rollin the die, a number greater than lastNumber is reached then teleport to the lastNumber. Find all final positions which can be reached by rolling the die once (1 to maxValue). (Working solution of this one).\\n2. Modified first problem, given teleporters, lastNumber, maxValue of die and startPosition, is it possible to reach the lastNumber by rolling the die any number of times.

      "content": "Hi Leetcoders, I am posting my interview experience with LinkedIn India for the Staff Software Engineer role. For the Staff role, they have total of 6 rounds: 1 Screening and 5 online rounds\r\n\r\nHere is the breakdown of all the rounds:\r\n\r\n**Round 1: Screening**\r\n\r\nIn this round, Firstly, I was asked to give my detailed career intro along with leadership/project related questions:\r\n\r\n1. Conflicting situations faced in any critical project\r\n2. Impactful project from which I was able to move out to other project with minimal disruption\r\n\r\nFew follow-ups were there and this discussion lasted for around 20 mins\r\n\r\nThen, I got a LC Hard DSA question : https://leetcode.com/problems/max-stack/\r\nI discussed 2-3 most optimal approaches and the interviewer agreed on one of the approaches to code it for all the helper methods along with discussion on Space and Time Complexity. Also, I was asked to dry run on a pre-written TC.\r\n\r\nRating : Strong Hire\r\n\r\n**Round 2: DSA 1: Staff Coding - Apps**\r\n\r\nQ1: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring\r\nThe problem was extended to a condition when the source string is wrapped around.\r\n\r\nQ2: Shortest path between LinkedIn connections. An adjacency list is given, a source and a target. Find the connection distance between source and target. Print the path as well.\r\nI discussed the optimal solution : Bi-directional BFS and coded for the same.\r\n\r\nRating : Strong Hire\r\n\r\n\r\n**Round 3: DSA 2: Staff Coding & Algorithms 2**\r\n\r\nQ1: https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder\r\nI gave the most optimized O(M*N) approach inspired by the below link:\r\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/submissions/1595132398\r\n\r\nQ2: https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance-ii\r\nGave the optimal 2-pointer approach.\r\nExtension: For the scenario if one string's occurences are less than other, used binary search for the more frequent string.\r\n\r\nRating : Strong Hire\r\n\r\n**Round 4: System Design**\r\n\r\nInitially, this round started with project and leadership based questions. Don't remember the exact questions, Apologies.\r\nNext, the interviewer covered the most complex project I recently led and covered about the security aspects and challenges faced. There were multiple follow-ups to understand my roles and responsibilities working as a tech lead.\r\n\r\nNext, I was given the below system design problem:\r\n\r\nDesign a flexible in-memory cache with customizable capacity and eviction policies.\r\n\r\nThe cache should allow users to define:\r\n  1.  Capacity: Specify how much data the cache can hold based on memory resources and data size.\r\n  2.  Eviction Policy: Choose strategies for removing items when the cache is full, such as Least Recently Used (LRU) or Lowest Priority.\r\n\r\nThis flexibility ensures the cache can be tailored to meet specific requirements, balancing resource usage and performance.\r\n\r\nOnce the LLD created was agreed with the interviewer, it was extended from HLD perspective for multiple nodes in distributed system setup covering all the challenges and other adhoc scenarios like hot key issue for a write-heavy setup. Also, discussion went around few Redis related internals.\r\n\r\nRating : Hire\r\n\r\n**Round 5: Craftsmanship**\r\n\r\nThis is mostly a behavioral based round for Staff role. It covered 8-10 scenario questions with internal follow ups. Questions were as follows:\r\n\r\n-> How do you define a quality product/system?\r\n-> Describe your strategy regarding code reviews\r\n-> Talk about a project that had many junior engineers and how I kept the project quality high/ If your team keeps growing and you get more junior engineers, what do you do?\r\n-> As a hypothetical situation, Imagine you join LinkedIn on a massive team that owns a legacy application. The application lacks adequate testing and monitoring and has slow response times. Consumers complain about this. Deployment of the application often contains bugs. What efforts would you do as a Staff SWE?\r\n-> Rank the following in terms of priority: bugs, no testing, no monitoring, slowness. What do you tackle first? How do you eventually turn this into micro services?\r\n-> What do you look for when determining the success of a service?\r\n-> What are your principles of mentorship? How do you manage technical and non-technical mentorship?\r\n-> Talk about a time where you helped grow engineers\r\n-> Few questions which were aligning with the LinkedIn values. Don't remember the exact questions.\r\nNote: Please be well-versed about Linkedin values.\r\n\r\nRating : Strong Hire\r\n\r\n**Round 6: Host Manager**\r\n\r\nThis round started with an elaborate introduction of both me and the interviewer.\r\n\r\nQuestions were as follows:\r\n1. Talk in detail about the most complex and challenging project I led in the recent times which had a very large scale. I framed my answer step-by-step as follows (along with few follow-ups from the HM):\r\n-> Team and My role\r\n-> Customer Problem & Business impact\r\n-> Key architectural decisions led/taken by me\r\n-> Biggest challenges faced and how did I overcome\r\n-> How did I maintain timely execution of the project\r\n-> Changes in reqs/unexpected blockers\r\n-> Ensuring alignment with stakeholders\r\n\r\n2. Why looking for change? Why LinkedIn?\r\n3. Describe a situation where you showed operational excellence.\r\n4. Describe a situation where you suggested improvements in the project which other engineers in the team could leverage from.\r\n\r\nThen at the end, he threw a HLD problem for designing a LinkedIn internal notification system which can handle a very large scale.\r\nThere were few cross-questions regarding the different internal microservices and Kafka being used for async handling.\r\nThis just had 10-15 mins at the end. Luckily, I was able to create the HLD diagram covering all the components.\r\n\r\n**Verdict** : Selected for the staff role after a week.\r\n\r\n**Compensation details :** \r\nBase salary: 88 LPA\r\nTarget bonus : 13.2 LPA (min 15%)\r\nPF : 4.25 LPA\r\nRSU: 350k for 4 years (75.5 LPA)\r\nRelocation bonus/services: ~ 5-7 L\r\nNet CTC per year : 1.85 Cr PA (++ unlimited LinkedIn Perks)\r\nYOE : 10\r\nCurrent CTC : 63 LPA (Microsoft : Senior SWE)\r\n\r\nHad another competing offers from Salesforce and Atlassian (~1.4 Cr PA), but finally I accepted the LinkedIn offer due to a better role and compensation.\r\n\r\nThanks to the Leetcode community for helping during my preparation and it's my time to give back to the community. Cheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Asked the API design, DB schema, microservices and then moved on to discussion on scaled up system. He asked questions on which components can act as a bottleneck and how can they be scaled.\\nThe verdict was positive.\\n\\n\\n**LLD Round** - Mobile Snake system design\\nI was a bit overwhelmed because i hadn\\'t attempted this question before and there were multiple requirements that were needed to be implemented.

      "content": "0. ### Karat Round\r\n    - Systems and debugging related questions - 5 questions. 3 of such are mentioned below. The theme was to ask clarifying questions and then suggesting and answer. \r\n        - For company XYZ, there is an old model for a smart fridge which sends data to the cloud for computation. The company now plans to launch a new fridge where the processing power will be in the new fridge. What possible issues do you forsee? (Answered, low processing power and slow computations. Interviewer seemed content. Constant firmware upgrade and lack of hardware upgrade since it's on client's side are good answers too.)\r\n        - A children's application converts children's vague drawing to animal animation and then the customers can choose the background for these animations from a fixed set of backgrounds. The animation is resource intensive. How do you plan to reduce the use of resources for this application? (Asked interviewer to clarify the nature of this animal animation converter, interviewer said, let's assume it identifies an animal and then animates. So suggested caching certain animations, once we identify an animal.)\r\n        - The company receives data from multiple sources and calculate stats on these sources. One such source is returning bad data, how do we tackle the situation? (Asked which type of stat are we calculating, average might be fine but median might not be. Interviewer said, it's a redundant stat, so the conversation went towards not pushing too many requests to the broken source for it recover. Also, to vote out the stat itself.)\r\n    - DSA Questions - 2 questions. I only recall one question. The second one was a follow-up to this one so it was similar in nature.\r\n        - You are given 2 lists, one is called entry, which is timestamp sorted list of names who badged in while entering the conference room and the second one is called exit, which is timestamp sorted list of names who badged out while leaving the conference room. People often make mistakes, they either forget to badge in or badge out. You need to make a list of such people who have made this mistake/violation.\r\n\r\n1. ### DSA round - 1 question\r\n    - Question related to creating a data structure which represented incrementing karma on some platform, similar to increasing likes for a YT video. The question on leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/all-oone-data-structure/\r\n\r\n2. ### DSA round - 1 question\r\n    - We want to implement a middleware router for our web service, which based on the path returns different strings (these would represent “functions to invoke” in a real application). \r\n    Usage:\r\n`Router.addRoute(\"/bar\", \"result\")`\r\n`Router.callRoute(\"/bar\") -> \"result\"`\r\nImplemented hashmap based solution wrapped in a class quickly. Then the follow-up.\r\n    - Search using wildcard is now possible\r\n`Router router = Router()`\r\n`router.addRoute(\"/foo\", \"foo\")`\r\n`router.addRoute(\"/bar/*/baz\", \"bar\")`\r\n`router.callRoute(\"/bar/a/baz\") -> bar`\r\n    Here the solution needed Trie. I suggested the same and interviewer said it was the right solution here. This trie\r\nneeds to be implemented by splitting the route by slash and keeping each word as a trieNode.\r\n\r\n3. ### System design question - 1 question\r\n    - Design a system where you return top confluence pages for the home screen. Top is decided by some metric say likes. The top screen needs to refreshed when new top posts come in. The top suggestions page should be renderable in any device, mobile, tablet, desktop. Final follow-up was about user recommendation since I clarified in my FR that this is going to all time top posts and not based on user recommendations. \r\n\r\n4. ### Managerial round - experience and behavioural questions. \r\n    - Generic behavioural questions but a [useful resource](https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/values-interviewing-atlassian.pdf)\r\n\r\n5. ### Values round - behavioural questions.\r\n    - Similar to above. Managerial is more about your experience and projects while values is more behavioural, I guess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Final call: No hire, despite green (hire call) on all rounds\r\n\r\n",

It was Nested Ordered Map based question. \n\n#### Round 4: HLD\n\nDesign a Tag Management System, was asked the multiple nity-gritties in the design. \n\n#### Round 5: Values Round\nStandard Behavioural questions on Atlassian Values. \nBe ready with multiple example from your past experiences, you will be grilled on your past experience. \n\n#### Round 6: Management Round\nSimilar to the previous round this round was based on Behavioural, but these were not based on Atlassian these were generalised questions. \n\n\n\nAfter 6 rounds, recruiter conveyed that hiring committee has taken a HIRE call. \n\nThen the recruiter scheduled team matching call with 4 different hiring managers. \n\nAccepted the offer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

At Atlassian – there are multiple groups, and each can have one or more groups. Every employee is part of a group. You are tasked with designing a system that could find the closest common parent group giv a target set of employees in the organization.\nb) The Atlassian hierarchy sometimes can have shared group across an org or employees shared across different groups – How will the code evolve n this case if the requirement is to provide ONE closest common group\nc) The system now introduced 4 methods to update the structure of the hierarchy in the org. Supose these dynamic updates are done in separate threads while getCommonGroupForEmployees is being called, How ill your system handled reads and writes into the system efficiently such that at any given time getCommonGroupForEmployees always reflects the latest updated state of the hierarchy?\nd) The company consists of a single level of groups with no subgroups. Each group has a set of employees.\n\nExpanding Tennis Club\na) Implement a function that given a list of tennis court cookings with start and finish times, returns a plan assigning each booking to a specific court, ensuring each court is used by only one booking at a time and using the minimum amount of courts with unlimites number of courts available.\nAn example of the booking record might look like\n\nClass BookingRecord:\nId: int//ID of the booking\nStart_time: int\nFinish_time: int\n\nAnd our function is going to look like:\n\nList assignCourts(List bookingRecords)\n\nb) After each booking, a fixed amount of time, X, is needed to maintain the court before it can be rented again\nc) Court only need maintainenece after X amount of usage\nHow would you modify the code if each court also had a Y maintainence time that occurred after X bookings?\nThe function should now become something like\nDef assign_court_with_maintainence(booking_records: list{BookingRecord],\n\nMaintainence_time: int,\n\nDurability: int) -> list[Court]:\nd) The original problem can be made simpler by removing the “assigning each booking to a specific court” part. The candidate needs to find the minimum number of courts needed to accommodate all the bookings\ne) Check if booking conflict - Write a function that if given two bookings to check if they conflict with each other\n\nCommodity Prices\nImagine you are given a stream of data points consisting of <timestamp, commodityPrice> you are supposed to return the maxCommodityPrice at any point in time.\nThe timestamps in the stream can be out of order, or there can be duplicate timestamps, we need to update the commodityPrice at that particular timestamp if an entry for the timestamp already exists\nCreate an in-memory solution tailored to prioritize frequent reads and writes for the given problem statement\nCan we reduce the time complexity of the getMaxCommodityPrice to O(1) if the language does not support it? This can be done using a variable to keep the maxPrice value, but we need to update it when performing the upsert operations.\n\nPopular content\nImagine you are given a stream of content ids along with an associated action to be performed on them\nExample of contents are video, pages, posts etc. There cam be two actions associated with a content id:\n• increasePopularity -> increases the popularity of the content by 1. The popularity increases when someone comments on the content or likes the comtent\n• decreasePopularity-> decreases the popularity of the content by 1. The popularity decreases when a spam bot’s/users comments are deleted from the content or its likes are removed from the content\n• content ids are positive integers\nImplement a class that can return the mostPopular content id at any time while consuming the stream of content ids and its associated action.

      "content": "I gave atlassian interview DSA round few days back. The question was very similar to the leetcode voting system. This round happened on local system. Unlike here we dont get the inputs and expected output in the question. We have to identiify that based on the statements given in the question. \\nIt took me some time to identify the input correctly. \\nQuestion - \\nProcess a list of ballots, and return all candidates sorted in descending order by their \\ntotal number of points.\\n// List<String> getResults(List<Ballot> ballots)\\nWe pass in a list of ballots and we return a list of candidate names in descending order of the \\ntotal number of points that each candidate received. Assume that we extract the candidates\\' names from the votes as we process them. A voter is allowed to vote for up to three different candidates. The order of the votes is important. The first vote that a voter places is worth three points. The second vote is worth two points. The third vote is worth one point. The function should return a list of candidates in descending order of the total number of points received by the candidate.\\n\\nThe solution was pretty simple (can check solutions on leetcode). However the interviewer asked follow up questions on this which was the tricky part. \\n1. How to handle the scenario where the candidates have the same points? What strategies can be used.\\n2. He proposed 2 strategies and I was supposed to implement both of them based on the input. \\n\\n1st Strategy -> supposed 2 candidates (A, B) have same points. We have to declare the candidate as winner whoever reaches the winning point 1st. \\n2nd strategy -> votes placed in the ballot. Whoever has the maxium votes in ballot at 0th index then 1st index and then last index.\\n\\nFor strategy 1 -> I implemented a doubly linked list having each node as set. Basically I was trying to implement the ALL O(1) problem\\'s solution. With help of this I can return the 0th index on the list\\'s node.\\nFor strategy 2 -> I tried maintaing an array of points at each index for each candidate. EG - A: [0,0,0]\\n\\nThe interviewer was looking for a better solution for strategy 1. I checked multiple time with him if he was looking for a continuous output - so that I can implement something similar to heap. But he told that only after getting all the votes we wanted to declare the winner.\\n\\nCan someone think of a better solution to the problem?\\n",

      "content": "I recently participated in the online coding round for Atlassian's Summer 2025 internship opportunity for the Software Development Engineering role. The round consisted of three questions that had to be solved within 90 minutes. Here's a detailed account of my experience:\n\n**Question 1: Merging Two Linked Lists**\nThe first question involved two linked lists, head1 and head2, and two integers, a and b. We had to merge the second linked list into the first one such that the ath node of the first linked list points to the head of the second linked list, and the tail of the second linked list points to the bth node of the first linked list. Essentially, we needed to insert the second linked list between the ath and bth nodes of the first linked list.\n\nI managed to solve this problem within 15 minutes, passing all 15 test cases successfully.\n\n**Question 2: Minimizing Cost with Coupons**\nThe second question provided a list of positive integers called price, where price[i] represents the price of the ith item. We were also given an integer m, which represents the number of discount coupons available. Each coupon could be applied to any item, and if x coupons were applied to an item priced at p, its new price would be floor(p / (2^x)). The goal was to minimize the total cost of buying all items using the coupons.\n\nI approached this problem with a greedy algorithm. My strategy was to apply coupons to the maximum element in the price list until all coupons were used up or the maximum element became zero. After that, I summed up all the elements in the list to get the minimum cost. I passed 12 out of 15 test cases; the remaining test cases resulted in a Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) error.\n\n**Question 3: Counting Non-Overlapping Intervals**\nThe third question involved two lists of positive integers of equal lengths, starting and ending, where starting[i] and ending[i] represent an interval (both inclusive). The task was to find the number of unique triplets of non-overlapping intervals.\n\nI initially thought of solving this problem using dynamic programming and began coding a recursive approach. However, due to time constraints, I could only pass 7 out of 15 test cases, with the remaining test cases resulting in TLE or Memory Limit Exceeded (MLE) errors.\n\nOverall, it was a challenging yet enriching experience. I learned a lot about optimizing my approach and managing time effectively under pressure.\n\n**Tip:** The order of questions in the actual assessment was different from what is listed here. I recommend quickly reading through all the problems first and then solving them in increasing order of difficulty. Tackling easier questions first helps build confidence, reduces stress, and provides a sense of accomplishment during the assessment.\n\nThanks for reading!",

Took > 6 Months to land offers. Sharing Month wise preparation and interview experiences.\\n\\n**March-April** **(*The initial burst of Motivation*)**\\n\\nThe news came as a shock to me and took couple of days to even register what actually happened. Started doing LC on a daily basis with occasional Design questions(HLD).\\nStarted applying from 2nd/3rd week of march, got a couple of calls but couldnt make it past the initial stages.\\nWas still very confident to close out the job hunt in 6-8 weeks.\\n\\n**Phonepe**: https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/5058789/phonepe-sde2-bangalore-55yoe [Reject]\\nInterviewed for **Arista Networks** but there were a lot of questions around Netwokring, hence couldnt clear it.[Reject]\\nAppeared for OA of **New Relic**, cleared the test and was asked to travel to a different city for in person interviews. Sadly i was going home at that time for Holi and asked the recruiter if its possible to reschedule it to next week to which she agreed. But tried reaching out to her multiple times the following week and didnt get any response.\\n\\nWasnt getting as many calls from recruiters as i expected earlier. Since i had very recently switched to the last company, my profile was not even getting shortlisted due to frequent job changes.\\n\\nStarted to lose confidence because of lack of responses.\\n\\n**May (*The Ghosting Phase*)**\\n\\nThats when i started to feel a bit(more) anxious. Till now only a couple of people around me knew about my job status as was too embarrassed to share it with my friends/family.\\n\\nStarted to get some responses from companies. Recruiter screens were getting scheduled but when i joined, no one attended the meeting. Inspite of Multiple followups on mails and on calls, didnt get a single response back from them.\\n**OCI** scheduled a recruiter pre screen and never showed up.\\n\\n**Microsoft** Recruiter reached out for a hiring drive, got my availability, didnt get any invite. Tried reaching out to the recruiter and via some friends internally as well, was updated that the interview will be scheduled the following week, nothing happened again.\\nThis happened 2-3 times and eventually i never got any invite for the interview.\\n\\nWas paralelly appearing for whatever Online Assessments i was getting from Microsoft or any other companies but even after clearing the tests, i wasnt getting any responses.\\n\\nBy the Second week of May, started to maintain streaks on daily questions on Leetcode and was more motivated than ever.\\n\\nDont remember if i gave any substantial interviews during this period.\\n\\n**June (*The month of Realization*)**\\n\\nKept on maintaining the streaks till June Mid.\\n\\nGave a few interviews:\\n**Microsoft**:  https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/5338820/microsoft-hiring-drive-june-7-bangalore [Reject]\\nNever got any update from the recruiter. All i ever got was \"***We are still waiting for the feedback***\" for months.\\n\\nBut still nothing seemed to be working out. Either i was somehow being put up with some unrealistic hard questions in interviews or i just messed up big time.\\n\\nAgain got Ghosted by couple of Companies.\\n\\n1. **Coackroach Labs** recruiter sync was scheduled, was recheduled multiple times but the recruiter never showed up.\\n2. Was shortlisted for **Zepto** drive and some other companies, never received any invites.\\n3. Cleared Online assessment for **Salesforce**, got the call from recruiter for an in person interview in bangalore in next couple of days but sadly i was in my hometown at that time. Requested to have the interview a few days later as it wasnt possible to travel back, but got no response even after multiple followups.\\n\\nI am no expert on the definition of depression but i didnt have anything to look forward to for the next day, started being in my own shell, didnt feel like sleeping at nights  since didnt want to face another day of applying for jobs and getting rejection mails. Stopped caring about myself, stopped talking to people, stopped enjoying anything and everything around me. Lost track of what day of the week it is. Thought about going to therapy multiple times but being jobless for months didnt go well with my finances so i guess it just felt like a waste of money.\\n\\nTowards mid of June took some mental break, went on a solo trip, spent some time with family (pretending to work infront of them).\\n\\n**July** (***Mixed***)\\n\\nHad sever mental breakdowns towards end of June and first week of July.\\nFirst couple of weeks were spent in trying to analyze whats going wrong and where can i improve myself. Was seeing people around me getting jobs in 4-6 weeks after starting to apply for jobs which again made me lose my confidence even more and question myself.\\n\\n*Still kept on lying to my friends\\' questions \"How\\'s work going?\" with a smile on my face.*\\n\\nAgain appeared for Microsoft interviews in an attempt to clear it this time, sadly, it was worse than last time. Got rejected after first round itself.\\n**Microsoft** : https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/5465329/microsoft-sde2-bengaluru-drive-10-july [Reject]\\n\\nBy the 3rd week of July, started getting a few calls from recruiters and had a few initial syncups, exploratory, tech screen rounds.\\nStepped up on the preparation even more.\\n\\n**August-Sept** (Well, Finally!!!)\\n\\nGave up on everything (sleep, workout, hanging out with friends, movies, deactivated Instagram, limited my Phone screen time). Was feeling mentally and physically exhausted on a daily basis with just a few hours of sleep.\\nFortunately, i had started to plan every day hour wise in order to accomodate interview schedules. Started giving 10+ interviews on a weekly basis and drives on the weekends (appeared for even more than 17 rounds of interviews a few weeks)\\n\\nThings started to happen at OCI. Yes there were some places where i could have done better but was still looking forward to an offer as overall the interviews went good. But sadly received rejection. This took a heavy toll on me but just somehow pushed myself to not crib about it prepare for the other upcoming interviews.\\n\\n**OCI** - https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/5758958/OCI-or-SMTS-or-6-Years-or-Reject [Reject]\\n**Microsoft** - Cleared initial OA and first 3 rounds, things messed up in the Hiring Manager round.

Rejected in virtual onsites [Reject]\\n**Zynga**: Rejected in first round [Reject]\\n**UIPath**: Rejected after second round [Reject]\\n**Allen**: Rejected after Round 2 [Reject]\\n\\nGot the first offer from Wayfair but somehow just wanted to get something better considering the negative reviews around the company.\\nEventually in the last week of August and first week of september got Offers from *Atlassian, Goldman Sachs and Salesforce* as well.\\n\\n***Purpose of this Post?*** : Someone out there might be in the same boat as me and might be losing hope as i did multiple times. And a reminder to self as well to not lose hope.\\n***My suggestion?*** : Keep pushing! Eventually things will fall into place and your hard work will payoff. You will get what you deserve. Sometimes all you can do is keep working hard and do the hardest possible thing: **WAIT!** \\nTo the jobs I applied in march/April, i was getting responses in July. I hate to say this but sometmes, yes luck can definitely be a big factor when it comes to job hunt. \\nLife is uncertain and more often than not things wont go even remotely close to how you planned them out. I had a lot of plans financially this year, everything just went down the drain. But this wont stop me from dreaming big and planning for my future.\\n\\n***What kept me going through this period?*** : Guess i am someone who tries to find something positive out of every situation. Always thought *\"I am gonna smile with a sense of pride when i make it past this phase and look back at it\"*. Always thought about how this phase would make me a better person and how this would make me mentally stronger than ever.\\nHad weeks where i didnt have anything to look forward to, no interviews, no responses, so just kept pushing myself in the GYM. That sense of progress towards the end of every week in the gym did give me some relief.\\nResorted to journaling, reading non-fictional books to keep myself sane through this period.\\nI am not an exceptional coder/developer. So tried working on my basics, even if i couldnt solve LC hard questions, kept on solving the medium/easy ones multiple times.\\nLeetcode community has been really helpful to me in my preparation, this collated list of interview experiences is just my attempt to give something back to the community.\\n\\n***Resources followed for LLD/HLD:***\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@TechDummiesNarendraL\\nhttps://www.udemy.com/course/system_design_lld_hld\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@gkcs\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@TheTechGranth/videos\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@codeKarle\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@SystemDesignInterview\\nGrokking the system design interview\\n\\n***Leetcode Stats***: 300+ (~170 Medium)\\nFollowed Blind 75 (54/75), Grind 169 (92/169), Neetcode 150 (80/150)\\nUsed to follow company wise questions for preparations as well. \\n\\nHave missed a few interviews in between, will add if i am able to gather the required information.\\nHope this helps whoever is reading it.\\n\\nKeep moving forward! :)",

How are Bonus payouts at both Atlassian and Salesforce? On a \"Meets Expectation\" rating, would it be 15%, or it would be awarded only in the case of exceptional performance?\\n\\nAny inputs would be helpful\\n\\nOther offers: \\nhttps://leetcode.com/discuss/compensation/5752010/Goldman-Sachs-or-VP-or-Bangalore\\n\\nhttps://leetcode.com/discuss/compensation/5752019/Wayfair-or-L3-or-Bangalore\\n\\n**Overall interview journey**: https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/5757913/6-months%2B-Interview-Prep-Journey-Laid-Off\\n",

Then, he went on asking below question:\\n```\\nImagine we have a system that stores files, and these files can be grouped into collections. We are interested in knowing where our resources are being taken up.\\nFor this system we would like to generate a report that lists:\\n- The total size of all files stored;\\n- The top N collections (by file size) where N can be a user-defined value\\n\\nAn example input into your report generator might look like:\\nfile1.txt (size: 100)\\nfile2.txt (size: 200) in collection \"collection1\"\\nfile3.txt (size: 200) in collection \"collection1\"\\nfile4.txt (size: 300) in collection \"collection2\"\\nfile5.txt (size: 10)\\n\\nSo, basically collections are like tags and files can be tagged. We have to implement methods that can return total size of all the files added to the system and topN collections. TopN collections is based on total size of all the files tagged with particular collection. In above example \"collection1\" has 2 files with total size 400, \"collection2\" has 1 file with total size 300 and there are 2 files without any collection with total size 110.\\nTop2 collections would return [\"collection1\", \"collection2\"]\\n```\\n\\n```\\nI approached with creating a File Object\\nclass File {\\n\\tString name;\\n\\tint size;\\n\\tString collection;\\n}\\n\\nclass FileCollection {\\n\\tString collection;\\n\\tint totalSizeInCollection;\\n}\\n\\nclass MemoryFile {\\n\\tPriorityQueue<FileCollection> queue;\\n\\tMap<String, List<File>> map;\\n\\tint totalSize;\\n\\t\\n\\tpublic MemoryFile() {\\n\\t\\tthis.queue = new PriorityQueue<FileCollection>((a, b) -> a.totalSizeInCollection - b.totalSizeInCollection);\\n\\t\\tthis.map = new HashMap<>();\\n\\t}\\n\\t\\n\\tpublic int totalSize() {\\n\\t\\treturn this.totalSize;\\n\\t}\\n\\t\\n\\tpublic void addFile(File f) {\\n\\t\\t// check in map where key -> collection, value -> list of all files belonging to this collection\\n\\t\\t// keep in mind, files without collection can be mapped to \"default\" collection (I basically took this approach and explained to interviewer and he was impressed :))\\n\\t\\t// increase the totalSize here as well.\\n\\t}\\n\\t\\n\\tpublic List<String> topN(int n) {\\n\\t\\t// traverse through map and create a FileCollection object and add to priorityQueue.\\n\\t\\t// if count is greater than n, poll from the queue and in the end we will have only N elements in the\\n\\t\\t// queue.

However, I wouldn\\'t claim myself to be a victim, because I know that nothing is permanent in this world (no job, no relation, not even our life!). This post is just for spilling some beans on this hi-fi incident, which has caught the attention of many influencer didis/bhaiyas. This post is not meant to hurt anybody\\'s (company or human) sentiments.***\\n\\n\\nThis unfortunate news comes just a couple of months before the anticipated joining date. Being so talented and facing this tough market situation, it\\'s hard to accept the fact that one might be jobless after graduation.\\nThis is the same remote company that claimed to be one of the most employee-centric workplaces on this planet. Also, the only company to have company values with slang words (do research if you do not know, but not hurting any company\\'s sentiments, just an observation).\\n\\n1. **Myth** - I have seen people comparing these folks with UPSC rankers, saying that cracking Atlassian is similar to cracking any Indian Government Job.\\n**Truth** - NO, IT\\'S NOT THAT TOUGH. PLEASE STOP SPREADING THESE FOOLISH RUMOURS. I AM SOMEONE WHO HAS SUCCESSFULLY CRACKED THESE INTERVIEWS, AND IF I COMPARE ATLASSIAN\\'S LEVEL WITH ANY FAANGM+ COMPANY INTERVIEW, I WOULD RATE IT AS 5/10. (THIS IS FOR FRESHER/INTERN INTERVIEW). SOMETIMES, I FEEL THAT WHEN PEOPLE MAKE SUCH REMARKS, THEY ARE KIND OF MAKING FUN OF THE AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS.\\n\\n2. **Myth** - These people had worked hard day and night, spending 30/24 hours daily to prepare for this hellishly difficult company.\\n**Truth** - Most of the affected individuals are just intern converts. Now, you might say that everyone must have worked hard to prove oneself during the 8-week internship. But the fact is, most of the people had only received very basic level of work, akin to some college semester project. Some were merely asked to read a topic and create a PowerPoint presentation out of it. Additionally, most of the documentation was simply copied and pasted from previously available documents on Confluence (Atlassian\\'s open forum where all the docs are available). Those who had the opportunity to write at least a couple of lines of code just copied it from the available codebase, sought help from seniors, and had their PRs merged by mentors themselves. Most of their time was spent in fun hours, worthless 1:1s among interns, discussing GOA trips, counting the stipend, and the CTC upon conversion.\\n\\n [**Note**: I have myself gone through some of these docs, so know the standards very well.]\\n\\nI remember, that once one of the interns was asking for some valuable work, as he wanted to put atleast something on his resume, as his experience from Atlassian and all that he got was - *Bhai, itna kyun tension le rahe ho performance or experience ko leke, itna stipend kama rahe ho, jao goa-woa ghumo, masti karo jeewan jiyo, tumhare time me humlog tcs se career start karte thhe paisa hi nahi hota thha hamare paas to*\\nOne of the other one said - *Dekho Atlassian ek already established company hai, yahaan aisa kuchh as such kaam nahi hai, agar zyada kam karne ka shauk hai to jaao kisi startup mein (then laughs).*\\nOnce of the employee said - *Dekho Mai to khud ko yahaan prove kar chuka hoon, isliye mujhe mehnat karne ki ab utni zaroorat nahi hai, agar aaj mere paas agar koi kisi important meet ke liye aaye aur doosri taraf mera chhota bachche mujhe khelne ke liye pukaare to mai apne bachche ke paas jaaunga, kyunki I have already proven myself when I was young and a struggler, tumlog to fresher ho, kyun start kar rahe ho apni career ek work from home wali company se?*\\n\\n3. The intern conversion rate for Atlassian was 95%. Moreover, in such a tough market situation, Atlassian had hired 180+ interns. Also, the 5% of interns who weren\\'t given the PPO (actually, these were the real lucky ones) were victims of internal politics, personal grudges, or favoritism. I have seen some really good folks being treated bluntly bad, being bullied for no reason. (I had a sense of something suspicious when I saw one intern being badly scolded by a skip-level manager for no fault of his, while another intern was treated like a blessing from heaven.) By this time, I was sure that this is an actual toxic workplace, and even if I land a PPO here, it would be better to keep some backup preparation.\\n\\n4. **Myth** - Remote companies offer an awesome work-life balance. Additionally, the \"Work from anywhere (even hell)\" concept of Atlassian is touted as really helpful.\\n**Truth** - However, the reality of remote work often includes a barrage of whole-day worthless meetings, a pervasive sense of laziness, with managers visibly disinterested, poor cooperation, and widespread confusion. It wasn\\'t uncommon for people to leave their laptops open and go on long breaks, as there were numerous occasions when I messaged team members and received no reply for the entire day (sometimes even for a couple of days, as interns were seen as burdensome by the employees).\\nThe number of interns exceeded the number of teams hosted by Atlassian India. Most managers were responsible for overseeing more than 5 interns, while mentors and buddies were tasked with mentoring multiple interns at once. With such a large intern cohort, teams struggled to allocate meaningful projects to each intern. The internship was divided into four cohorts - 20th April joiners (20 interns), 4th May joiners (30 interns), 15th May joiners (95+ interns), and 5th June joiners (~45 interns). According to teams, most project ideas had been exhausted by the first two cohorts, leaving the last cohort feeling more like a burden. (I was from the third cohort and was fortunate enough to have some meaningful tasks to work on.) Upon connecting with a peer from the last cohort, I learned that he had received his offer in August, 2022, whereas some interns from the second cohort were hired around December, 2022. The rationale behind this cohort division remains unclear.\\n\\n5. The internship recruitment process at Atlassian wasn\\'t fair. Many highly talented individuals were subjected to bullying during the interview process (the reasons behind which remain unclear). On the other hand, many average candidates were only asked questions at the level of array swapping (believe it or not, it\\'s true). Additionally, I heard rumors about internal sourcing for certain candidates, even for on-campus placements.\\n\\n6. Last year, Atlassian engaged in excessive hiring. I heard that there were expected full-time graduates who were supposed to join from July. During our team stand-ups, there was concern about what work should be assigned to these new joiners. Additionally, there were several contractors who were employed seemingly without reason and were always hovering around trying to secure some work.\\nFurthermore, there was a lot of advertising about an 83.54 LPA CTC at Atlassian, but the reality was just a base of 15.4 LPA.\\n\\n[**About myself**] - When I landed this internship at Atlassian, a DAY 0 company, I was ecstatic. However, when I shared the news with some relatives with over 15 years of industry experience, they advised me to explore other off-campus opportunities (due to my college\\'s single internship policy).\\nAt that moment, I was dazzled by the 1.3L stipend. Yet, after some research and discussions with seniors, I became aware of the unpredictability surrounding Atlassian India.\\nDuring my internship, I noticed biased behavior towards certain individuals, which raised suspicions. The excessive advertising, inflated CTC, and rampant hiring in a tight market only fueled those suspicions.\\nAfter receiving the PPO, I found myself constrained again by my college\\'s single placement policy. Just two days ago, my worst fear materialized before my eyes. I\\'ve taken these days to absorb the shock, but today, when I opened LeetCode to practice, I stumbled upon a post from someone seemingly depressed: https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/5042799/Atlassian-Offer-Revoked. It concerned me deeply.\\nI don\\'t blame anyone for my current situation. I acknowledge that I let my serious preparation slide over the past two years because of this offer, a situation shared by almost everyone who received it. Despite numerous suggestions, I didn\\'t pursue off-campus opportunities. In truth, I became complacent after securing the PPO.\\nI often pondered the misfortune of those mistreated at Atlassian or denied a PPO. Yet now, seeing them thriving in secure positions or excelling in DSA/development, I can\\'t help but feel envious.\\n\\n",

Each customer may have purchased licenses for several of these products. Every product has different types of entities, such as Sprints, Features, and Tasks in Jira, documents in Confluence, and Code Repositories in BitBucket. The owner can assign hashtags to these entities.\\n\\n**Example**: For a project called \\'Project-XYZ\\', all related Jira tickets, user stories, Confluence documents, and BitBucket code reviews can be tagged with `#project-xyz` for easier tracking.\\n\\n**Functional requirements**:\\n1. **Fetches all tagged entities**: The system should efficiently retrieve all entities owned by a customer that are tagged with a specific hashtag, across multiple products.\\n2. **Top 10 Hashtags**: Design a solution to identify the top 10 hashtags globally (across all customers) with the most tagged entities. Similar to \"Top-K leader board problem\"\\n\\n**Non-functional requirements:**\\n1. The system should be highly configurable to allow new product types and entity types to be added.\\n2. Hashtags are dynamic, with no pre-defined set, meaning users can create any tag.\\n\\nThe focus was on schema design and choosing the right database and mapping structure for efficient querying.\\n\\n#### _For Frontend Roles:_\\nA friend shared insights from the frontend system design round. The task was to design a dynamic sprint dashboard where users could modify the dashboard by adding columns such as \\u201CBacklog,\\u201D \\u201CScheduled,\\u201D \\u201CIn Progress,\\u201D etc. Each column could contain entities like tasks or stories.\\n\\nThe key areas of focus were:\\n- **Reusable UI Components**: The UI components, such as tasks or stories, should be reusable. For example, a Task should be rendered using the same UI component each time.\\n- **Versioning**: Instead of modifying existing UI components, the idea of creating a new version of the component, similar to versioning in backend systems (e.g., Maven), was emphasized.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### [V.Imp.] Management Round: Don\\'t go unprepared!!\\nThis round is for Senior Engineer roles, and **it\\'s MANDATORY to clear, even if you ace the technical rounds!** People with 5-6 years of experience might not have had the chance to lead a project where they managed others acting as a project lead. But this round expects candidates to have managerial experience.\\n\\nI strongly recommend checking `URL-1`, Atlassian\\u2019s official documentation. It lists their 5 values with 2 sample questions for each. Trust me, interviewers ask straight from this!\\n\\nIf you lack managerial experience, don\\u2019t admit it. Prepare responses that demonstrate your ability to lead. For example, if asked about a time when you improved someone\\'s performance, don\\u2019t just mention helping them to learn a technology. Instead, say your colleague was newly promoted to a Senior role and was having a hard time managing resources and tracking progress. You helped him with best practices that you learned from your experience, such as setting up a dedicated project call outside of the daily standup to thoroughly assess progress. This response shows you understand team dynamics and can coach others.\\n\\nEvery answer should aim to showcase strong managerial experience and knowledge of best practices. The interviewer will be a manager!\\n\\n___\\n\\n### Values round\\nEverything I said about the managerial round applies exactly to this one as well.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Preparation\\nFor details on how I prepared, check out my [Google interview experience blog](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/5547675/Google-Interview-questions-and-preparation/).",

      "content": "Hi all,\n\n\nTLDR - Grind for about 8 months and nothing in hand, now have offers from Amazon, Uber, Atlassian, Microsoft. Want to give back to community.\n\n\nThis is in continuation to my last post I posted few months earlier \n\nhttps://leetcode.com/discuss/post/5688796/what-am-i-doing-wrong-with-interview-pre-4ne9/\n\nTC - 75LPA\nYOE - 5Y\n\n# Journey\n\nI was facing lot of issues in getting interview and was very frustated, to summarize I had started preparation in May'24 and by end of the year I had given interviews of almost all major companies and lots of startups and mid sized comapnies with just one very low balled offer. Few ghosted after clearing all the rounds and many gave random reasons for rejection. \nI was devasted after getting all these rejections but fortunately decided not to give up, kept working for it.\n\n# Results\n\nComing to Mar'25 I got my first offer which I thought is a good one. It's a mid-sized company and they were good work in e-commerce domain, I was particularly very excited but decided its time to move on and took the offer. I had few interviews lined up and this is when things started to really work in my favour. Few days after this I got an acceptance from Microsoft. I was very very happy, they offered lot better compensation and we all know about the perks. I kept giving interviews in my lineup, later on converted Uber and Atlassian as well. I was waiting on writing this post as I was yet to hear from Amazon and got an acceptance from Amazon as well. I have decided to go ahead with Atlassian but I am now very confident that I would be able to get the most out of myself and work to my full potential with confidence.\n\n# Why am I writing this ? \n\nThis is not a brag post, I generally don't like to talk about this. I am writing this to tell anyone who is going through the same phase as I was few months back that if you keep working towards it you will definitely see results. I myself had kinda given up and thought that there is no pickng up my career from here but kept faith in myself and made it work. This post is to tell you to keep faith in yourself and keep all the negative thoughts out of your mind and just keep working towards it. Also I have learnt a lot from going through different leetcode posts and this is my way of giving back to the community, I would also be answering each and every question in detail and to best of my abilities. \n\n# What I would do differently going ahead ? \n\n1. Being organized really really help, keep a tab on the list of comapnies you can apply and keep following up.\n2. LinkedIn network work, I am in the process of optimizing my linkedin network so I can see more relevant posts which would give me good market overview. \n3. Organized studies - I was always hoping that next comapny should be the one and therefore was always just studying keeping the next interview I have in mind because of which I had to go through many things repeatdely. Instead focusing on the next interview I would focus on all the topics I have to cover and study them in depth.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nMany thanks to everyone who has been directly or indirectly part of my journey and helped me, thanks to the community. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t",

LeetCode medium and another hard-level question.\\nI could choose to redo this round within 48 hours, and the best of the two rounds would be considered for evaluation. I wasn\\'t feeling positive and decided to redo.\\nPersonally I felt this is a difficult one due to its strict time bound policy.\\nI cleared this round, and HR scheduled the next round. Every round was an elimination round.\\n\\nCode design - I was given a real-world design statement and had to code it with an executable solution. Function signatures were given. It involved some system-level APIs as well. The interviewer asked about its internals and discussed if I had to implement what change I would implement to make it more usable, efficient etc. The code was tested against some test cases.\\n\\nData structures - It involved solving a problem with a combination of data structures, and you had to write code in a way that you could extend it to implement the follow-up question. I made a small mistake, used the wrong map, and some test cases were failing. But after some debugging, I figured it out.\\n\\nSystem design - I was asked to design a question similar to social media. We had a discussion on various DB tables, which database to use and why, what are some features of that database, API endpoints, minimum possible API endpoints and DB tables, pagination, indexing, user experience. The follow-up was about changes I would make to the system and why if I got a second chance.\\n\\nValues - I was asked a \"tell me about a time\" type of question, but the focus was on Atlassian values.\\n\\nManagerial - I was asked several questions about my past experiences dealing with situations of conflict, teamwork, team leading, cross-organization impact, etc.\\n\\nMy advice - Don\\u2019t take the managerial and values rounds lightly. Based on the performance in these rounds, Atlassian can downlevel or even reject you. For senior roles P50, P60, these two rounds are most important, and the questions they ask are not that easy to answer compared to SDE2 or lower levels. Expectations are high for these roles.\\n\\nAtlassian\\'s compensation is on par with Microsoft, Amazon, and Google.\\n\\nAnd finally, I cleared the interviews and happily joined the organization.\\n\\nfeel free to connect me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/puneet-saini-61a2b48a/\\n",

      "content": "Status: 9 years experience, M.Tech CS\\nPosition: SDE2 at Microsoft\\nLocation: Noida, India\\nDate: January 13, 2024\\n\\nHR screening round: The HR asked me some basic questions like trees, binary search, some database questions, and about my work and experience.\\n\\nKarat- The format was to spend 20 minutes on 5 system design questions and 30 minutes on coding, where two questions had to be solved with running code. LeetCode medium and another hard-level question.\\nI could choose to redo this round within 48 hours, and the best of the two rounds would be considered for evaluation. I wasn\\'t feeling positive and decided to redo.\\nPersonally I felt this is a difficult one due to its strict time bound policy.\\nI cleared this round, and HR scheduled the next round. Every round was an elimination round.\\n\\nCode design - I was given a real-world design statement and had to code it with an executable solution. Function signatures were given. It involved some system-level APIs as well. The interviewer asked about its internals and discussed if I had to implement what change I would implement to make it more usable, efficient etc. The code was tested against some test cases.\\n\\nData structures - It involved solving a problem with a combination of data structures, and you had to write code in a way that you could extend it to implement the follow-up question. I made a small mistake, used the wrong map, and some test cases were failing. But after some debugging, I figured it out.\\n\\nSystem design - I was asked to design a question similar to social media. We had a discussion on various DB tables, which database to use and why, what are some features of that database, API endpoints, minimum possible API endpoints and DB tables, pagination, indexing, user experience. The follow-up was about changes I would make to the system and why if I got a second chance.\\n\\nValues - I was asked a \"tell me about a time\" type of question, but the focus was on Atlassian values.\\n\\nManagerial - I was asked several questions about my past experiences dealing with situations of conflict, teamwork, team leading, cross-organization impact, etc.\\n\\nMy advice - Don\\u2019t take the managerial and values rounds lightly. Based on the performance in these rounds, Atlassian can downlevel or even reject you. For senior roles P50, P60, these two rounds are most important, and the questions they ask are not that easy to answer compared to SDE2 or lower levels. Expectations are high for these roles.\\n\\nAtlassian\\'s compensation is on par with Microsoft, Amazon, and Google.\\n\\nAnd finally, I cleared the interviews and happily joined the organization.",

      "content": "Status: 7+ years of experience in backend development\\nPosition: SSE at Walmart\\nLocation: Bangalore, India\\nDate: April 2024\\nTotal Process Time: Approximately 1 to 1.5 months\\n\\nKarat Round (1 hour):\\n\\nOne coding question with a lengthy input and expected output, such as an array of strings of strings. The logic was simple, but I don\\u2019t remember the exact question. It was of medium or easy to medium difficulty.\\nFive theoretical system design questions. Try to provide as many points as possible. For example, to improve system latency, you can mention adding cache, CDN for static content, adding database indexes, etc. Each question has 5 minutes allotted, and HR will share a format for the same.\\nResult: Selected\\n1st Technical with Atlassian LLD or Design (1 hour):\\n\\nAtlassian often asks about designing a rate limiter, which was the case for me as well (x requests in y time). I proposed a moving window approach, but I was removing all requests from the queue within the time window. The interviewer suggested processing only one request, reducing the time complexity from O(windowLength) to O(1). The interview went well, and the interviewer was very friendly. We finished a bit early and talked about common hobbies, etc.\\n2nd Technical with Atlassian or DS:\\n\\nIn this round, they asked about a voting algorithm where each person gets votes in order (e.g., (ABC) -> A having 3 votes, B 2, and C 1). The goal was to return the most voted person. This question is common in many Atlassian rounds. Then, they asked a similar version, focusing on how I would handle the algorithm, follow the Open-Closed Principle, and add a function to the interface. The coding rounds were not hard; just follow standard design processes.\\n3rd HLD:\\n\\nDesigned a service to get the most viewed or liked page. Discussion points included:\\nHow to maintain a list of likes. Should I maintain viewed IDs or just a count? Pros and cons.\\nHandling a scenario where a new page becomes the most liked next year while still showing users the previous year\\'s top page. I proposed using a NoSQL database mapped to each day with a list of pages, but the interviewer preferred Cassandra DB, stating we wouldn\\u2019t consider this year\\'s data. I was unsure how to solve this, resulting in a pass with a P40 ranking, which decreased my interest in Atlassian.\\n4th Managerial:\\n\\nI expected a mix of technical and behavioral questions, but it was entirely behavioral. The interviewer expected STAR format answers, and I felt I didn\\'t perform well. Overall, it was a simple round.\\n5th Values:\\n\\nFocused on Atlassian\\'s five values. Prepare a story for each value and answer in the STAR format. Nothing special.\\nOverall, I did well in the Karat round and the first two technical rounds but was weak in the HLD and managerial rounds. The main rejection came from the managerial round, but I was approved in the values round. In my experience, cracking Atlassian isn\\'t that hard; you don\\'t need to solve all of LeetCode and lots of DS questions. Prepare some design patterns, stay confident, stay calm during interviews, and have a sip of water if needed. However, I don\\'t like their practice of downgrading to lower roles, which they do often. I also heard they revoked offers for freshers, so I was a bit skeptical during the interview.\\n\\nRequest for Community:\\nI am good at DS and have passed DS rounds in all my interviews but have failed in HLD and sometimes in LLD. Any tips for improvement?",

Question is summarized into basically:\\n\\n***You are given a series of intervals for what a user wants to \"trim\" from a video of a given duration.

It\\'s pretty messy but I had trouble conceptulaizing the task and eventually came up with:\\n\\n```\\ndef calculate_inverse_range(trim_ranges, duration):\\n    sorted_trim_ranges = sorted(trim_ranges, key=lambda t: t[\"from\"])\\n\\n    i = 0\\n    previous_interval = None\\n    current_interval = None\\n    intervals = []\\n    \\n    while True:\\n        if i > (len(sorted_trim_ranges) - 1):\\n            break\\n\\n        current_interval = sorted_trim_ranges[i]\\n\\n        if current_interval[\"from\"] != 0:\\n            begin = previous_interval[\"to\"] if previous_interval else 0\\n            end = current_interval[\"from\"]\\n\\n            intervals.append({\\n                \"from\": begin,\\n                \"to\": end\\n            })\\n\\n        previous_interval = current_interval\\n        i += 1\\n    \\n    if current_interval[\"to\"] != duration:\\n        intervals.append({\\n            \"from\": current_interval[\"to\"],\\n            \"to\": duration\\n        })\\n    \\n    return intervals\\n```\\n\\nThe fourth test case involved collapsing overlapping intervals, which I struggled to come up with a quick solution for and ended up with a brute-force N^2 algorithm that *almost* worked by modifying the ranges but I didn\\'t manage to get it working (I needed to also remove the now-merged ranges)\\n\\n```\\ndef collapse_ranges(sorted_trim_ranges):\\n    \"\"\"\\n        { \"from\": 5, \"to\": 15 },\\n        { \"from\": 10, \"to\": 20 },\\n        { \"from\": 35, \"to\": 50 },\\n        { \"from\": 30, \"to\": 40 },\\n    \"\"\"\\n    \\n    range_map = []\\n\\n    for i in range(len(sorted_trim_ranges)):\\n        inclusive_overlapping = False\\n\\n        start = sorted_trim_ranges[i][\"from\"]\\n        end = sorted_trim_ranges[i][\"to\"]\\n\\n        for j in range(i):\\n            if (\\n                sorted_trim_ranges[i][\"from\"] > sorted_trim_ranges[j][\"from\"] and\\n                sorted_trim_ranges[i][\"to\"] < sorted_trim_ranges[j][\"to\"]\\n            ):\\n                inclusive_overlapping = True\\n            elif (\\n                ( sorted_trim_ranges[i][\"from\"] > sorted_trim_ranges[j][\"from\"] and\\n                    sorted_trim_ranges[i][\"from\"] < sorted_trim_ranges[j][\"to\"]\\n                ) and\\n                sorted_trim_ranges[i][\"to\"] > sorted_trim_ranges[j][\"to\"]\\n            ):\\n                # New range begins at previous start, current end\\n                start = sorted_trim_ranges[j][\"from\"]\\n                end = sorted_trim_ranges[i][\"to\"]\\n        \\n        if not inclusive_overlapping:\\n            range_map.append({\\n                \"from\": start,\\n                \"to\": end\\n            })\\n        \\n\\n    return range_map\\n```\\n\\t\\nAny thoughts / ideas on how I could have solved this optimally?",

The main topics were API enpoints, pagination and remained time (not much) on databases.\\n\\n**The question which took the most time** was about PUT endpoint which updates tags for a page or ticket (contentId)\\n```\\nPUT /content/{contentId}/tags\\n{tags:[]}\\n```\\nThe iterviewer ask consider huge amount of tags hundred thousands and more. I replied it does make too much sense and better to have a restriction like maximum tags for the content, the interviewer insisted to consider huge amount of tags. **What do you think the proper solutions for this case?**\\n\\nMy thoughts (happy to hear feedback):\\n**a**. Using the simple PUT method :\\n- Start with one million tags, each 10 bytes in size, for a total of around 10 megabytes. You can also use this as an attached file.\\n- Apply gzip compression, achieving a 95% reduction, resulting in a manageable 500 kilobytes, which is not too large for a networking operation.\\n- Upon receiving the compressed data, you can split it into chunks and process it in data stores asynchronously using messaging queues. This approach also leverages bulk update capabilities if they are available and necessary.\\nAs a viable alternative, for large files containing new data, consider uploading them to a shared storage system like S3 and then sending an HTTP reference to this file.\\n\\n**b**. Another approach that was discussed leans towards the candidate\\'s expectations and aligns more naturally with handling large data \\u2013 the idea of splitting data into manageable batches or chunks. The primary concept here involves breaking down substantial data on the client side and then transmitting it to the server. Afterward, the data can be reassembled on a storage system like S3 and processed piece by piece asynchronously using messaging queues, taking advantage of bulk update capabilities if needed.\\n- It\\'s crucial to note that batch and bulk processing doesn\\'t seamlessly adhere to the core principles of REST. It\\'s often more efficient to send a single request with the file as mentioned in a above. One of the primary reasons for this is the verbosity of HTTP (each request contains metadata like headers, etc.), which leads to considering alternative approaches such as streaming methods like websockets, which are less verbose.\\n- For a scalable and reliable method of uploading large files, split into batches or chunks, there\\'s an open-source protocol known as Resumable Uploads (https://tus.io/). It enjoys support across various platforms, including Java, iOS, Go, .Net, and more. It would be prudent to explore this protocol before attempting to create a custom solution for batch uploading over HTTP.\\n\\n**Remaining part of the interview** :\\nIt was a bit confusing because the requirement above about hunderd thousands tags should flow in other parts. Still had some good discussions: I provided a comprehensive explanation regarding pagination, delving into the nuances of both offset and cursor options, complete with trade-offs and illustrative examples. This discussion encompassed querying pages based on tags and considerations for the dashboard.\\nI shared my insights on the database structure, involving the segmentation of tags, statistical pages per tag, and a fast tag-per-pages mechanism. These recommendations were accompanied by strategies like caching, sharding, consistent hashing, and replication, all of which I justified in response to the interviewer\\'s inquiries.\\nAdditionally, we explored non-functional requirements, touching on critical aspects such as performance, availability, scalability, and durability. These considerations were central to our conversation. Furthermore, we addressed topics related to logging and monitoring during our discussion.\\nThe interviewer made small traps such as insisting that POST and PUT can be used interchangeably, which I was not agreed with, advocating idempotence for PUT and etc.",

Started doing LC on a daily basis with occasional Design questions(HLD).\\nStarted applying from 2nd/3rd week of march, got a couple of calls but couldnt make it past the initial stages.\\nWas still very confident to close out the job hunt in 6-8 weeks.\\n\\n**Phonepe**: https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/5058789/phonepe-sde2-bangalore-55yoe [Reject]\\nInterviewed for **Arista Networks** but there were a lot of questions around Netwokring, hence couldnt clear it.[Reject]\\nAppeared for OA of **New Relic**, cleared the test and was asked to travel to a different city for in person interviews. Sadly i was going home at that time for Holi and asked the recruiter if its possible to reschedule it to next week to which she agreed. But tried reaching out to her multiple times the following week and didnt get any response.\\n\\nWasnt getting as many calls from recruiters as i expected earlier. Since i had very recently switched to the last company, my profile was not even getting shortlisted due to frequent job changes.\\n\\nStarted to lose confidence because of lack of responses.\\n\\n**May (*The Ghosting Phase*)**\\n\\nThats when i started to feel a bit(more) anxious. Till now only a couple of people around me knew about my job status as was too embarrassed to share it with my friends/family.\\n\\nStarted to get some responses from companies. Recruiter screens were getting scheduled but when i joined, no one attended the meeting. Inspite of Multiple followups on mails and on calls, didnt get a single response back from them.\\n**OCI** scheduled a recruiter pre screen and never showed up.\\n\\n**Microsoft** Recruiter reached out for a hiring drive, got my availability, didnt get any invite. Tried reaching out to the recruiter and via some friends internally as well, was updated that the interview will be scheduled the following week, nothing happened again.\\nThis happened 2-3 times and eventually i never got any invite for the interview.\\n\\nWas paralelly appearing for whatever Online Assessments i was getting from Microsoft or any other companies but even after clearing the tests, i wasnt getting any responses.\\n\\nBy the Second week of May, started to maintain streaks on daily questions on Leetcode and was more motivated than ever.\\n\\nDont remember if i gave any substantial interviews during this period.\\n\\n**June (*The month of Realization*)**\\n\\nKept on maintaining the streaks till June Mid.\\n\\nGave a few interviews:\\n**Microsoft**:  https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/5338820/microsoft-hiring-drive-june-7-bangalore [Reject]\\nNever got any update from the recruiter. All i ever got was \"***We are still waiting for the feedback***\" for months.\\n\\nBut still nothing seemed to be working out. Either i was somehow being put up with some unrealistic hard questions in interviews or i just messed up big time.\\n\\nAgain got Ghosted by couple of Companies.\\n\\n1. **Coackroach Labs** recruiter sync was scheduled, was recheduled multiple times but the recruiter never showed up.\\n2. Was shortlisted for **Zepto** drive and some other companies, never received any invites.\\n3. Cleared Online assessment for **Salesforce**, got the call from recruiter for an in person interview in bangalore in next couple of days but sadly i was in my hometown at that time. Requested to have the interview a few days later as it wasnt possible to travel back, but got no response even after multiple followups.\\n\\nI am no expert on the definition of depression but i didnt have anything to look forward to for the next day, started being in my own shell, didnt feel like sleeping at nights  since didnt want to face another day of applying for jobs and getting rejection mails. Stopped caring about myself, stopped talking to people, stopped enjoying anything and everything around me. Lost track of what day of the week it is. Thought about going to therapy multiple times but being jobless for months didnt go well with my finances so i guess it just felt like a waste of money.\\n\\nTowards mid of June took some mental break, went on a solo trip, spent some time with family (pretending to work infront of them).\\n\\n**July** (***Mixed***)\\n\\nHad sever mental breakdowns towards end of June and first week of July.\\nFirst couple of weeks were spent in trying to analyze whats going wrong and where can i improve myself. Was seeing people around me getting jobs in 4-6 weeks after starting to apply for jobs which again made me lose my confidence even more and question myself.\\n\\n*Still kept on lying to my friends\\' questions \"How\\'s work going?\" with a smile on my face.*\\n\\nAgain appeared for Microsoft interviews in an attempt to clear it this time, sadly, it was worse than last time. Got rejected after first round itself.\\n**Microsoft** : https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/5465329/microsoft-sde2-bengaluru-drive-10-july [Reject]\\n\\nBy the 3rd week of July, started getting a few calls from recruiters and had a few initial syncups, exploratory, tech screen rounds.\\nStepped up on the preparation even more.\\n\\n**August-Sept** (Well, Finally!!!)\\n\\nGave up on everything (sleep, workout, hanging out with friends, movies, deactivated Instagram, limited my Phone screen time). Was feeling mentally and physically exhausted on a daily basis with just a few hours of sleep.\\nFortunately, i had started to plan every day hour wise in order to accomodate interview schedules. Started giving 10+ interviews on a weekly basis and drives on the weekends (appeared for even more than 17 rounds of interviews a few weeks)\\n\\nThings started to happen at OCI. Yes there were some places where i could have done better but was still looking forward to an offer as overall the interviews went good. But sadly received rejection. This took a heavy toll on me but just somehow pushed myself to not crib about it prepare for the other upcoming interviews.\\n\\n**OCI** - https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/5758958/OCI-or-SMTS-or-6-Years-or-Reject [Reject]\\n**Microsoft** - Cleared initial OA and first 3 rounds, things messed up in the Hiring Manager round.

And a reminder to self as well to not lose hope.\\n***My suggestion?*** : Keep pushing! Eventually things will fall into place and your hard work will payoff. You will get what you deserve. Sometimes all you can do is keep working hard and do the hardest possible thing: **WAIT!** \\nTo the jobs I applied in march/April, i was getting responses in July. I hate to say this but sometmes, yes luck can definitely be a big factor when it comes to job hunt. \\nLife is uncertain and more often than not things wont go even remotely close to how you planned them out. I had a lot of plans financially this year, everything just went down the drain. But this wont stop me from dreaming big and planning for my future.\\n\\n***What kept me going through this period?*** : Guess i am someone who tries to find something positive out of every situation. Always thought *\"I am gonna smile with a sense of pride when i make it past this phase and look back at it\"*. Always thought about how this phase would make me a better person and how this would make me mentally stronger than ever.\\nHad weeks where i didnt have anything to look forward to, no interviews, no responses, so just kept pushing myself in the GYM. That sense of progress towards the end of every week in the gym did give me some relief.\\nResorted to journaling, reading non-fictional books to keep myself sane through this period.\\nI am not an exceptional coder/developer. So tried working on my basics, even if i couldnt solve LC hard questions, kept on solving the medium/easy ones multiple times.\\nLeetcode community has been really helpful to me in my preparation, this collated list of interview experiences is just my attempt to give something back to the community.\\n\\n***Resources followed for LLD/HLD:***\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@TechDummiesNarendraL\\nhttps://www.udemy.com/course/system_design_lld_hld\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@gkcs\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@TheTechGranth/videos\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@codeKarle\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@SystemDesignInterview\\nGrokking the system design interview\\n\\n***Leetcode Stats***: 300+ (~170 Medium)\\nFollowed Blind 75 (54/75), Grind 169 (92/169), Neetcode 150 (80/150)\\nUsed to follow company wise questions for preparations as well. \\n\\nHave missed a few interviews in between, will add if i am able to gather the required information.\\nHope this helps whoever is reading it.\\n\\nKeep moving forward! :)",

      "content": "In software development, a circuit breaker is a design pattern used to prevent a service from becoming overwhelmed or failing in the event of an error or too much traffic. It acts as a safety valve that stops the flow of traffic to a service when it detects an error or a high number of requests.\\n\\nIn JavaScript, a circuit breaker can be implemented by creating a wrapper function around the code that is prone to failure or high traffic. The wrapper function monitors the number of errors or requests and determines whether to allow traffic to pass through to the original function.\\n\\n\\n\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/d2a8ef72-b337-4fbc-bba7-e270a91de805_1682944220.111995.png)\\n\\n\\n```\\nfunction circuitBreaker(originalFunction, failureThreshold, recoveryTime) {\\n  let failureCount = 0;\\n  let lastFailureTime = null;\\n  let isOpen = false;\\n\\n  return function(...args) {\\n    if (isOpen) {\\n      const timeSinceFailure = new Date() - lastFailureTime;\\n      if (timeSinceFailure > recoveryTime) {\\n        isOpen = false;\\n      } else {\\n        throw new Error(\\'Service is unavailable\\');\\n      }\\n    }\\n\\n    try {\\n      const result = originalFunction(...args);\\n      failureCount = 0;\\n      return result;\\n    } catch (error) {\\n      failureCount++;\\n      lastFailureTime = new Date();\\n\\n      if (failureCount >= failureThreshold) {\\n        isOpen = true;\\n      }\\n\\n      throw error;\\n    }\\n  };\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\nThis function takes three parameters: the original function that we want to wrap, the failure threshold (the number of allowed failures before the circuit breaker is triggered), and the recovery time (the amount of time to wait before trying the original function again).\\n\\nThe circuit breaker function returns a new function that acts as a wrapper around the original function. The wrapper function checks if the circuit is open, and if it is, it either throws an error or waits for the recovery time to expire before allowing traffic through again. If the circuit is closed, the wrapper function calls the original function and catches any errors. If the number of errors exceeds the failure threshold, the circuit is opened, and traffic is stopped from passing through until the recovery time has passed.\\n\\nTo use this circuit breaker, we can pass our original function to the circuitBreaker function along with the desired failure threshold and recovery time:\\n\\n**For more frontend interview questions, can download this ebook -** https://mohit8.gumroad.com/l/ygass",

Usually this means my interviews didn\\'t go well but i really doubt it (Cross verified it with other FAANG principal engineers). Feel free to judge the solution yourself though.\\n\\n**First round - Coding**\\n\\nWas given leetcode medium - Leader election and 3-4 variations of election algorithm. Was able to finish all the variations. Got a hire call in couple of days.\\n\\n**Second round - LLD**\\n\\nTypical Rate Limiter question. Asked me to code \"X requests in Y seconds\" and how would i make it extendable.\\n\\nFirst off, interviewer was rudee - came late, no introduction whatsoever, assumed the interviewee is familiar with various rate limiting algorithms.\\n\\nAnyway, implemented fixed time window algorithm (after choosing between token bucket or sliding time window) with appropriate interfaces.\\n\\n```\\ninterface RateLimiter {\\n  boolean allow(int timestamp);\\n}\\n\\nclass FixedWindowRateLimiter implements RateLimiter {\\n \\n  FixedWindowRateLimiter(int reqCount) {}\\n  \\n  @Override\\n  boolean allow(int timestamp) {\\n    // impl\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\nThe way i implemented the algorithm was a bit unusual (I\\'ll keep that detail to myself) and i could see interviewer googling because interviewer wasn\\'t familiar with what a specific line did. I explained that to him, also offered him that i can make this thread-safe - to which he said no.\\n\\nInterviewer further asked, what if i want to extend it like rate limit based on customerId - what will i change? I told him my approach (but didn\\'t code as i was running out of time - One might wonder why i was running out of time - HE CAME LATE!) that i would create subclasses like below:\\n\\n```\\nclass RateLimiterByCustomerId {\\n  Map<CustomerId, RateLimiter> rateLimiter = new HashMap<>(); // concurrenthashmap to make it thread safe\\n  \\n  RateLimiterByCustomerId(Configuration cfg) {\\n    // read config and now you have per customer allowed values e.g. 10 reqs/s for c1, 5 reqs/s for c2 and so on!\\n    rateLimiter.put(customerId1, new FixedWindowRateLimiter(n1));\\n    rateLimiter.put(customerId2, new FixedWindowRateLimiter(n2));\\n    rateLimiter.put(customerId3, new SlidingWindowRateLimiter(n3)); // different type of rate limiter supported\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nSimilarly you can extend it by IP Adress or whatever attribute (you can even mix and match as well with these interfaces). Interviewer didn\\'t seem convinced with this approach - I asked him what problems you see with this approach? He said \"You\\'d create new class for every rate limiter by attribute value?\" - I said - \"Not by attribute value but by different attribute like IP Address or Customer Id\". I didn\\'t think he understood what i wanted to convery, only if i had time to code maybe :shrug:.\\n\\nRecruiter reached out with feedback \"It didn\\'t go as well but we\\'ll consider you for Senior engineer\".\\n\\nFinal outcome - Took a pass as i had another offer (can\\'t disclose details as i told recruiter) and my second round experience was very bad. No hate towards the company but clearly i was a mismatch with culture second interviewer portrayed.",

Men need to stop blaming us for their rejections/failures which we are also facing. Believe it or not, we are all in the same boat. To face unfair treatment just like you and then be blamed if we get selected is the reason diversity hiring is justified. You are ready to pounce on us for things we are not responsible. I don\\'t see girls blaming men for their rejections. But I do see why men are blamed for lower headcount of women in higher positions, after all these posts taking frustration out on women candidates.\\n\\nInterviews are >50% luck.

The recruiter mentioned that it would be a 45-50 minute interview, with first 20 minutes revolving around System Design design concepts, followed by coding questions.\\n\\n**SD Questions: **\\n\\nRoughly 5 or 6 different scenario based questions were asked revolving around system design concepts. I can roughly recall the following:\\n\\nFor the following scenarios, which would be better - Strong consistency/Eventual consistency. Explain reasons why. About 3 scenarios were given, one of which was a Banking application.\\n\\nThe interview gave a scenario for Google docs and multiple users can access the same document, and google docs uses a Round Robin load balancing approach. Do you see any issues with using such an approach.\\n\\nOne question was related to finding the max throughput of a system. It was sort of like a graph diagram, with various about 6 stages labeled A to F, and the throughput they operate on. I was asked to calculate the max throuhput of the system.\\n\\nOne question was related to a scenario where they were using a relational database, and two tables were provided with a foreign key reference. They wanted to see how we can scale such a system (I believe they were looking for data partitioning/sharding techniques that we could apply.)\\n\\nAnother scenario was something like that there was a bug on an application, and you ended up having a lot of failed requests. You have a database that stores all IDs that are there, and you also have large log files from about 500 different production servers that log the IDs of the successful requests. How would you come up with a solution to find the IDs that were missing/\\n\\n**Coding Question : **\\nWe are working on a security system for a badged-access room in our company\\'s building.\\n\\nWe want to find employees who badged into our secured room unusually often. We have an unordered list of names and entry times over a single day. Access times are given as numbers up to four digits in length using 24-hour time, such as \"800\" or \"2250\".\\n\\nWrite a function that finds anyone who badged into the room three or more times in a one-hour period. Your function should return each of the employees who fit that criteria, plus the times that they badged in during the one-hour period. If there are multiple one-hour periods where this was true for an employee, just return the earliest one for that employee.\\n\\nbadge_times = [\\n  [\"Paul\",      \"1355\"], [\"Jennifer\",  \"1910\"], [\"Jose\",    \"835\"],\\n  [\"Jose\",       \"830\"], [\"Paul\",      \"1315\"], [\"Chloe\",     \"0\"],\\n  [\"Chloe\",     \"1910\"], [\"Jose\",      \"1615\"], [\"Jose\",   \"1640\"],\\n  [\"Paul\",      \"1405\"], [\"Jose\",       \"855\"], [\"Jose\",    \"930\"],\\n  [\"Jose\",       \"915\"], [\"Jose\",       \"730\"], [\"Jose\",    \"940\"],\\n  [\"Jennifer\",  \"1335\"], [\"Jennifer\",   \"730\"], [\"Jose\",   \"1630\"],\\n  [\"Jennifer\",     \"5\"], [\"Chloe\",     \"1909\"], [\"Zhang\",     \"1\"],\\n  [\"Zhang\",       \"10\"], [\"Zhang\",      \"109\"], [\"Zhang\",   \"110\"],\\n  [\"Amos\",         \"1\"], [\"Amos\",         \"2\"], [\"Amos\",    \"400\"],\\n  [\"Amos\",       \"500\"], [\"Amos\",       \"503\"], [\"Amos\",    \"504\"],\\n  [\"Amos\",       \"601\"], [\"Amos\",       \"602\"], [\"Paul\",   \"1416\"],\\n];\\n\\nExpected output (in any order)\\n   Paul: 1315 1355 1405. // 1315-1415\\n   Jose: 830 835 855 915 930\\n   Zhang: 10 109 110\\n   Amos: 500 503 504\\n\\nn: length of the badge records array\\n\\nVerdict : Rejected.

We spent about half an hour on this problem.\\n\\nI want to contribute this question because there are multiple solutions using different techniques (i.e. dsu, math) that perform better than the brute force solution. I think this question would be a LeetCode Medium.\\nDescription\\nGiven an array A of size n, where A[i] denotes the student number (A[i]=i, for all 1<=i<=n). Given another array B of size n such that i\\xAD\\xAD\\xAD\\xADth student of array A is the friend of the ith student of array B ( i.e, A[i] and B[i] are friends) and a student can ask doubt his friend. You have to tell that is the doubt of student \\u2018K\\u2019 will be solved in less than T minutes or not? (If a student \\u2018X\\u2019 asks doubt to student \\u2018Y\\u2019, it takes one minute time and if student \\u2018Y\\u2019 don\\u2019t know the answer, he can ask his friend.\\n\\nIf any student asks the doubt to himself, then he got the answer in just one minute. \\n\\n<u>Note</u>\\n\\nNote that Time will be consumed only in asking the doubt, not in answering.\\n \\n\\nExample:\\n\\nGiven n=7,A = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], B=[5,1,1,3,7,5,7,7],K=4 and T=6\\nOutput will be 1.\\n\\n \\n\\n<u>Explanation </u>\\n\\nGiven array A is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\\n\\nGiven array B is 5 1 1 3 7 5 7 7\\n\\n          K=4 and T=6\\n\\nNow,\\n\\nAt T= 0, student 4 will ask doubt to student 3 because 3 is the friend of 4.\\n\\nAt T= 1, student 3 will ask doubt to student 1 because 1 is the friend of 3.\\n\\nAt T= 2, student 1 will ask doubt to student 5 because 5 is the friend of 1.\\n\\nAt T= 4, student 5 will ask doubt to student 7 because 7 is the friend of 5.\\n\\nAt T= 5, student 7 will ask doubt to student 7 because 7 is the friend of 7 and as student 7 is friend of itself he gets the answer and pas back to student K(4) through the friends of friend.\\n\\n \\n\\nSo, the student K will get his answer within T(6) minutes because he takes only 5 minutes to solve his doubt.\\n\\nHence, result will be 1.\\n\\nSolutions\\n\\tUse the concept of disjoint set and try to find a student who is friend of itself.\\n\\tIf you get such student within T minutes, return 1, otherwise return -1.   \\n\\n#include <iostream>\\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>  \\nusing namespace std; \\nbool find(int K,int B[],int cnt,int T)\\n{ \\n    if(K == B[K])\\n    { \\n      \\tif(cnt<T)\\n      \\treturn true;\\n      \\telse\\n      \\treturn false;\\n\\t}\\n    if(cnt>=T)\\n    return false;\\n    \\n    return find(B[K],B,cnt+1,T);\\n}\\nint doubtSolver(int n,int A[],int B[],int K,int T)\\n{  \\n\\tbool res=find(K,B,1,T);\\n\\tif(res==true)\\n\\treturn 1;\\n\\telse\\n\\treturn -1;\\n}\\n \\nint main()\\n{  \\n  \\n  int n;\\n  cin>>n;\\n  int A[n+1],B[n+1];\\n  for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)\\n  cin>>A[i];\\n  for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)\\n  cin>>B[i];\\n  int K,T;\\n  cin>>K>>T; \\n  int res=doubtSolver(n,A,B,K,T);\\n  cout<<res;\\n  return 0;\\n}\\n\\nTest Cases\\nInput:  n=7,A = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], B=[5,1,1,3,7,5,7,7],K=4 and T=6\\nOutput: 1\\n\\nInput:  n=6,A = [1,2,4,3,5,6], B=[1,3,2,1,5,6],K=3 and T=2\\nOutput: -1",

All the rounds at Atlassian are supposed to be conducted on the same day.\\n\\n**Interview Round 1: DSA**\\n\\nThis was completely DSA round in my case, no other questions were asked to me. \\n\\nThis round lasted for one hour and I was asked only one DSA-based problem statement a kind of open-ended problem which could have many solutions. \\n\\nThe problem was pretty simple in the start and I was able to code it out in 5 - 10 minutes, then the interviewer kept on adding variations to it and the same problem was discussed though out. \\n\\nSome of the famous Atlassian DSA problems are: \\n1. Rate limiter\\n2. HashMap implementation methods\\n3. String Matching algorithm\\n\\nMy interview ended at 9.30 AM and at 9.33 AM I received the mail that my next round is scheduled at 10 AM. (super fast :D)\\n\\n\\n**Interview Round 2: System Design**\\n\\nThis round may last one hour or more depending on your interviewer. and we were asked only one problem statement a kind of open-ended problem which could have many solutions. \\n\\nThe interview started with a discussion of the requirements of the system and questions were asked as I went on with my approach. \\n\\nI was able to design the system well with the databases, api, and component diagram but my interviewer was focused only on the algorithm of the design and as a result, I was rejected after this round.\\n\\n\\nSome of the famous Atlassian system design problems are: \\n1. Rate limiter\\n2. Unique Id generator\\n3. Book my show\\n4. Tagging system\\n5. Colour picker\\n6. Scheduler\\n\\nAnd, for the third round, basically, no technical questions were asked as I got to know from my friends but this round was also equally difficult as everything was asked in detail including your projects, internship work, college work, etc. You will be judged based on Atlassian core values. \\n\\n\\n",

Recruiter screening call\\n3. Code design Round -> Asked to design router class which takes a route as string and does some action with mapping the correct operation. Ask clarifying questions write the tests first, approach abstracted blueprint and then finally implement the logic. I used my own VS code with screen share as I had node and linter installed.\\n4. Data structures round -> Focuses on choice of correct data structure for the problem. Design a directory structure and sort by size of inner folders like windows explorer. Again the same write test, abstract the blueprint of prototype methods and implement two functions total size and sort.\\n5. System design -> Design a web crawler which stores the result(hyperlinks of image tags) and using api can request latest job output say a post call with host name. I designed a Async system which stores result using a kafka topic per host. Crawling could be done from node script or spring boot jar and feed the output to kafka topic. Also can have duplication avoiding mechanism, graceful failure of jobs etc Overall this round lasted 20 minutes over the scheduled time as interviewer was quite interested in the solution\\n\\nOverall good process also it was incremental i.e. previous round\\'s result affected candidacy for next round(except 3 and 4 which happened back to back).\\n\\nRejected with reason that they got another candidate from Netherlands will be glad to consider if similar profile is open again.

Consequently, I may receive grants at a high valuation, potentially resulting in a loss.\\n4. While Coinbase and Atlassian offer full remote work, Amazon requires relocation to Bangalore.

      "content": "pre-interview: Got reached out by some recruiter on LinkedIn\\n\\neducation: Tier 1 State University\\nprior experience: ~3+yoe, SDE2 at one of FAANG (at the time of the interview)\\ndate of interview: July-August 2022\\n\\n**1st Round: Tech screening ~ Kar*t**\\n\\nRecruiter mentioned that this would be a elimination round, if I passed this, a full onsite loop comprising 5 more rounds would be set up.\\n\\nThis is a typical Kar*t screening with 15 minutes alloted to theory based questions on various topics like debugging, loggging, OOP, database schema, scaling, sharding, load balancing. It was kind of like a quickfire round with the interviewer trying to ask as many questions as possible. I answered all of them, and seemed the interviewer was staisfied.\\n\\nThe next part was a DSA question , don\\'t remember the exact statements but it was a LC easy where we were expected to encrypt a given string based on a given substitution cipher For eg: If the order of appearence in string is - b k m w it will be mapped in the following manner a - b , b - k, c - m , d - w . Ignore non-alphabet characters and lowercase, uppercase should map to same character in same case. Something like this.\\n\\nIt could be easily solved using hashmap, but I fumbled somewhere and wasn\\'t getting the expected output on running the code. I took some 5-10 mins to debug with cout statements & it seemed the interviewer somehow liked the fact that I was actively trying to find the issue instead of dry running mentally.\\n\\nFinally it ran succesfully, and I had just 10 minutes remaining. The interviewer gave me another question which was a LC medium-hard I suppose. It could be solved by a conditional backtracking algorithm, I didn\\'t have enough time to write the code so interviewer said pseudocode is fine & after that he asked me to run the algorithm over some given sample inputs. I did & it seemed he was satisfied.\\n\\nI would rate my performance here a 9/10.\\n\\n**2nd Round: LLD**\\n\\nThe usual famous rate limiter question. I first implemented using a sliding counter based approach but interviewer was not satisfied with the approach for some reason. I was around 30 minutes into the interview. To me the algorithm seemed fine, and when I asked him to give some examples where it would not work he was unable to give but asked me to try some other approach, instead of arguing with him, I decided to use the remaining time in coming up with the conventional queue based sliding window approach. He was satisfied with this solution. After this, in the remaining 5 minutes he briefly asked some follow up questions on real life implementations of rate limiters and how they could be designed. In my company we have rule engine configuration based rate limiters so told him about the architecture of the same.\\n\\nI would rate myself a 8/10 in this round.\\n\\n**3rd Round: Data structures & problem solving**\\n\\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/\\n\\nI solved it first using the min heap based approach. Then gave a time & space complexity analysis to the interviewer.\\n\\nSince we had around 10-15 mins left, he asked if there\\'s some other approach. I shared another approach using count sort. He was satisfied & asked me to again do a time & space complexity analysis of the same. I did , and then we compared both the approaches & discussed when which approach would be more optimal, depending upon the input dataset.\\n\\nI would rate myself a 9/10 in this round.\\n\\n**4th Round: System design**\\n\\nDesign trending videos on Youtube.\\n\\nThis was by far my favourite round and the interviewer seemed a great person and we had a nice discussion starting from the services involved, the API request response structures, the choice of database, the DB schema. My approach was to design a ingestion pipeline to stream video view count telemetry which would then be used to build a hit counter kind of system. This would then go into a ranking engine with weighted ranking algorithm based on various metrics & finally each video would be assigned a %ile score determining their position in the \"trend\". We discussed on various aspects like DB sharding, pagination, how the services would scale, various LB algorithms like round robin, weighted round robin, etc.\\n\\nI really enjoyed giving this round.\\n\\nI would rate myself a 8/10 in this round. (I am mostly a backend engineer so I called out upfront I will not be able to cover the ML side of things in the ranking, he said that\\'s completely fine since this is a SDE role and his primary expectation was the system architecture & the scaling aspects)\\n\\n**5th Round: management**\\n\\nThis was the usual \"tell me about when you ....\" situational questions on how to handle various challenges - both technical & behavorial. I followed the STAR format to answer these & had plenty of experiences in my current company to draw examples from of collaborating with multiple teams to deliver product & tech milestones. Be prepared for these beforehand, because these rounds will typically be taken by senior folks(P5 and above) and they\\'ll be able to drill down & cross question whatever you say. We had some interesting tech discussions on how our SDLC works e2e, what kind of oncall responsibilites I had, how our deployment practices were and how we did A/B testing, etc.\\n\\n**6th Round: values**\\n\\nMost questions are on Atlassian values & I was prepared with a few datapoints & examples of each.\\n\\nIt took around ~1 month for my debrief & I was informed I passed debrief. After that it took me around ~10 months to get matched with a HM who had an approved headcount on their team & get the offer letter.\\n\\nOffer details: https://leetcode.com/discuss/compensation/3970811/Atlassian-P4-India",

      "content": "Just finished a long round of interviews which ended up spanning a good chunk of this year. The path is tedious, but spoils come to those who persist my friends! Started this run back in Feb. prior to the first of these I had been doing prep here and there for the last few months of 2020 and had cleared a Snr. DS interview for MS towards the end of 2020. January started to get a bit more serious in prep. for an upcoming onsite in Feb. then on and off study until May where prep. was pretty full on until I burnt out in July and finally just crossed the line. \\n\\n__Reddit - Sr. MLE (Reject)__\\nOverall, not too bad of a process, really depends how lucky you get with your recruiter, mine did not seem to care at all. For MLE\\'s the system design was a standard SDE system design question not a MLE design question like a lot of other companies will ask. Feedback here was I passed all but sys design, I didn\\'t prep for SDE style design questions for this interview.\\n\\n__LinkedIn - Sr. MLE (Reject)__\\nKind of weird experience here. My initial recruiter was awesome, once I got to the onsite they transferred me to a different one who couldn\\'t care less and gave zero help for prep. Anyway, interview questions were a mix of standard and stupid. Coding interviews my interviewer programmed in Java and assumed Python had the same support the same default data structures which it unfortunately does not. The \"data coding\" interview was terrible, interviewer turned up 20 minutes late, instead of rescheduling pushed to proceed, silly question/concept as well. The \"Data mining product design\" was stupid, not a standard MLE design interview. Study probability for these, they won\\u2019t necessarily mention to study it, but I got drilled on a couple of interviews for not brushing up. Received a template rejection email, as expected.\\n\\n__Google (Phone Screen Only) - SDE ML (Reject)__\\nMin sliding window in 2D/mtrx.. Ouch. Brute force no bueno... Maybe next time.\\n\\n__Grubhub Staff DS (Reject)__\\nReally strange. Recruiter had no idea what the interview would be about, spent 2 weeks trying to get information which ended up being conflicting and changed about 5 times. Ultimately the feedback was all positive apparently but they decided to change the requirements for the role or some BS.\\n\\n__Atlassian - Sr. MLE (Passed)__\\nLoved the process for this company! Professional, genuinely interested interviewers, job related tech questions, all good until the onsite for a technical ML interview where the interviewer didn\\u2019t know anything about ML\\u2026 Very strange, but this also happened to be the HM, so some red flags. Passed all the interviews, I wasn\\u2019t convinced of the team I\\u2019d be joining so asked to look for possible other opportunities within the company where I could have a greater impact.\\n\\n__Apple - Snr. MLE (Waiting)__\\nNice process, the details of the role I was interviewing for were not clearly defined so it took a few different conversations up to the director level to determine exactly what they were looking for. Overall the people I met with were mostly great and seemed mostly interested. The questions were fair but there was no preparation information given by the recruiter.\\n\\n__Microsoft - Sr. Data & Applied Scientist (Offer)__\\nA little hit or miss (I interviewed for a couple of different roles) but appreciated the first tech screen being with the HM (let\\u2019s you get a sense of who you\\u2019ll be working with early on). Turned out to be an enjoyable interview process, all questions were fair and relevant and I thought I did pretty well through all. Ended up getting an offer which I am very happy about!\\n\\n__FB - ML SDE E5 (Reject)__\\nStandard FB process you read about. You know their rules, you know what you need to study, show up ready to play! I think I did pretty decent, didn\\u2019t miss a coding question (one question I got target time complexity but not optimal mem.). Most questions were from LC. I received feedback that I did well in coding and system design, but needed more signal in behavioral and ML system design (which are both usually my strengths). My ML sys design question was CV domain for which I have little to no experience in (CV is not mentioned on my resume at all) and my recruiter told me they shouldn\\u2019t have asked that question, the interviewer even said \\u201CI know this is isn\\u2019t your area of expertise\\u201D\\u2026 No favors there. After the panel met, they decided not to give me a shot at those rounds again which was very disappointing as my recruiter was really optimistic they would at the very least or pass me to hiring comittee and I would think no decent person could reject someone for not passing a behavioral because they don\\'t have exceptional responses for every scripted \\'tell me a time when....\\' question. We were wrong.\\n\\n___** In addition to these I recieved another offer and was rejected from two other smaller companies following onsites.___\\n\\nMy advice to anyone still reading is stick with it. Interviewing is not easy, most of us will fail many times but persistence and perseverance are truly needed. I personally do not come from a traditional CS background, so have always had a lot of self doubt in this industry, especially when interviewing and especially coming from a more DS background for DS + algorithm coding interviews in the more engineer focused roles! This interview season I learned a bunch, and in addition to a new role which we always hope for, is something that only increases your skills/market value which you can always keep building on \\u2013 it will get easier. While you can never rely on luck, I feel like most of the time you need a little luck to get an offer, one bad interviewer, one bad question is all it can take sometimes to miss out on an opportunity. Keep going, you will find the interview where everything goes your way!\\n\\n__Prep:__\\n- Coding: Leetcode grind, looked over some algo books, fairly long preparation ~5 months, doing all explore topics (the relevant ones), the blind 75 (used this list multiple times if I took a few weeks break from coding to get back on track, which I did a few times), and then just hit the FB (and other companies I would interview for) and common interview questions lists, followed \"similar question\" paths from these questions to solidify understanding of key concepts. I\\'m also big on visual learning, so algorithms/data structures I was learning I would often draw to help get a visual and rememeber key pieces of information.\\n    -  https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf\\n- Sys Design: For this I used the most common resources - youtube, sys design primer etc. This was my least prepared area, I\\'d say 90% of my interviews were mainly focused on ML Sys design questions. \\n- ML Sys Design: ML basics I have covered, for more practical use cases (outside of what I generally work with) I read a lot of tech blogs (FB, linkedIn) and used presentations from OReilly online and youtube to take notes, sketch systems etc. Also the other standard resources books on OReilly, popular blogs etc. I found a framework that I tried to use for all of the use cases I found, and would structure my notes accordingly and that\\'s how I\\'d structure my thoughts/flow during the interviews.\\n  - https://huyenchip.com/machine-learning-systems-design/design-a-machine-learning-system.html\\n  - https://ai.facebook.com/blog/powered-by-ai-instagrams-explore-recommender-system/\\n  - https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/topic/artificial-intelligence?page=1   \\n\\nIn general I tried to code most days to stay sharp. I would try to learn a new system over a week or so and explore components or concepts I was unfamiliar with and take notes so I could revise. I\\'d find common design patterns (eg. ML recommender systems, search systems etc.) and ensured I had a good enough general understanding of them to recite off the top of my head.",

We want to avoid one customer being able to overload the system by sending too many requests, so we enforce a per-customer rate limit. The rate limit is defined as:\\n\\n\\u201CEach customer can make X requests per Y seconds\\u201D\\n\\nAssuming that customer ID is extracted somehow from the request, implement the following function.\\n\\n\\n// Perform rate limiting logic for provided customer ID. Return true if the\\n// request is allowed, and false if it is not.\\nboolean rateLimit(int customerId)\\n```\\n\\nAfter solving this, Interviewer asked follow up question:\\n\\n```\\none of our customers have bursty traffic, and are complaining about being rate limited. We want to better accomodate those customers, so we want to adopt a \\u2018credit\\u2019 based system. It will work as follows:\\n\\nFor each bucket of time, any capacity available below the limit is converted into credits for that customer\\n\\nThere is some maximum number of credits that a customer can accumulate\\n\\nWhen a customer exceeds their normal request limit for a window, the credit count starts to decrease. When there are 0 credits, the customer is rate limited.\\n```\\n\\n**Coding Round (Data Structures Interview) :** \\nI don\\'t remember questions.\\n\\n\\n**Design Round (System Design Interview) :**\\n\\n```\\nDesign a Tagging system for JIRA and this system can be used with other products as well.\\nSystem should be highly Available and Fault Taulrance \\n```\\n\\n\\n**Values Interview**\\n\\n`Interviewer asked some behavirol question which I don\\'t remember.`\\n\\n**Management Interview**\\n\\n```\\nInterviewer asked about my current and past experince. \\nWhy I am looking for job change?\\nWhy Atlassian?\\nand some behaviroul question.\\n```\\n\\n**Final Outcome:** \\n`I got call from HR after debrief that I got selected for P4 role and they will work on matching the Salesforce SMTS compensations.`\\n\\n**Reason why I not got selected for P5 role:**\\n```\\nHR mentioned that Panel think I will need lot of guidance and hand holding in Atlassian to be successful SSE.\\n```\\n\\n**Offer**: https://leetcode.com/discuss/compensation/1565994/Atlassian-or-P4-or-Bangalore\\n\\n**Note:** Inteviewer didn\\'t close the Hackerrank link after first coding round that\\'s why I am able to provide the descriptive question details.\\n\\n\\n",

      "content": "I am sharing my experience of interviewing with Atlassian. The whole process is divided into the following sections:\\n\\n1. Online Test:\\nThe online test was conducted on Hackerrank. The time duration was 90 mins and there were 3 problems.\\nProblem 1:\\nThis was a variation of https://leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people/. \\nProblem 2:\\nIt was a simple problem(75 pts).\\nThere were two strings a,b. We had to delete every occurence of string b in a (and after deleting again the same process in the modified string).\\nProblem 3:\\nThis was a standard problem(100 pts).\\nYour are given n and an input array with n numbers.\\nYou have to tell the minimum number of operations needed to pick each element from the input array make a sorted arrangement.\\nEvery insertion and removal is 1 operation.\\nA sorted arrangement is basically an array that is sorted.\\nlets understand with example..\\nlet n be 4\\nand input array be 2 4 1 3\\nso first we take 2 and insert in the empty sorted arrangement. so 1 operation\\nthen the sorted arrangement is- 2\\nthen we pick 4 and put it in the sorted arrangement.. so we would put after 2 so 1 operation\\nthen the sorted arrangement is- 2 ,4\\nthen we pick 1 and put it in the left so 1 operation..\\nthen the sorted arrangement is- 1,2,4\\n(now this is important)\\nnow we pick 3 and put we can either remove 1 and 2 put 3 and then again put 2 and 1 back or we can remove 4 , put 3 and again put 4.\\nobviously the latter takes 3 operations and former takes 5 operations. so we would perform the latter one.\\nanswer is 1+1+1+3=6 operations.\\n12 people were shortlisted out of 200 and I was one of them.\\n2. Technical Round 1:\\nThere was one interviewer and he was really cool and amazing. It was conducted on Zoom.\\nSo, firstly he introduced himself and asked me to do the same. Then he told me to discuss any of my project. There were many follow up questions like why did I chose the tech-stack which I used, and many more. \\nThen, he asked me my favourite CS subject (except for DS Algo as he was going to give me a coding question later on), so I answered OS and DBMS. So he chose DBMS and asked me about some core concepts like, Normalisation, ACID properties, joins, deadlock etc.\\nAfter this he asked me about my internship experience and also wrapped some HR questions in between( which were related to the core values of Atlassian).\\nNext, he asked me to share my screen and gave me a question to code. \\nHe gave me this question https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/.\\nThe actual thing they wanted to test was how I approach the problems. How I debug them (Very important). How to handle corner cases? How to keep things simple? All the while, expressing what u are really trying to do rather than being quiet and coding. Also, he wanted me to write a proper working code, which I did.\\nHe was very encouraging and enthusiastic!\\n3. Technical Round 2:\\nThis round consisted of a single interviewer and was conducted on Zoom.\\nIt was a code pair round on Hackerrank. It was very long and very exhaustive.\\nIt can also be subdivided into multiple phases:\\nPhase 1:\\nDiscussion on projects. I mentioned multiple projects involving REST APIs, MongoDB, NodeJS etc.\\nIt took more than 0.5 hrs. The focus was on:\\nWhat does it mean? Why u chose this over others?\\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages? What are the technical challenges u faced?\\nEx: Why REST APIs? Why MongoDB? etc.\\nPhase 2:\\nIt was a problem-solving round.\\nThe interviewer was not being very clear about the requirements of the problem so it took really some time to understand the problem. So, I suggest u to understand the problem by repeatedly asking clarifying questions.\\nThe question was mainly to implement LRU cache.\\nPhase 3:\\nHe asked me some basic questions on CN.\\nThe interview was scheduled for 1 hr but it went for 1hr 20 mins approximately. But, it was very interesting and I loved discussing concepts with the interviewer.\\nQuestions I asked the interviewer:\\nWhat are the opportunities I would have at Atlassian?\\nThe points he talked were really helpful and exciting.\\nHow his experience has been till now?\\n\\nIt was an amazing experience.\\nThis concludes my experience with Atlassian. Hope this article helps to get an understanding of the interview process at Atlassian.\\n\\nAll the best!!",

As I was the team lead of the project, so I was handling the team. I had two projects, so around 45 minutes were given to the projects and tell me about yourself. After that he asked me ds algo question which I had to answer verbally only.\\n\\n**4. HR Round(Round 3) **\\n\\nIt was conducted on Zoom and was of 1 hour.

      "content": "Hello everyone,\\n\\nFirst things first, thanks a lot for your help and support throughout my preparation journey. \\nI would like to share my interview experience to give back to the community.\\n\\nI interviewed with Facebook (E5), Google (L5), Microsoft(L64), Uber (L5A) and Atlassian(P5).\\nGot down-leveled to E4 in Facebook, received offers from Google and Microsoft and had to cancel 1-2 remaining rounds of Uber and Atlassian because of time constraints (More details later)\\n\\nHere\\'s my preparation and interview journey: \\n\\n**February 2021** : \\n\\nA Google recruiter reached out to me via LinkedIn and I decided to give it a shot and connected with her sometime in 2nd half of Feb. After a ~30 minutes chat with her I knew it\\'s not going to be easy and I need to start preparing ASAP. Didn\\'t even have a Resume to share it with her. \\n\\nI did not give any interviews for 7 years and was out of touch. I created my Leetcode account last year when one of my friend who joined Facebook, told me about it. But I barely solved 4-5 easy/mediums by this time. I was also not prepared for system design interviews. Bought Leetcode subscription.\\n\\n**March 2021** :\\n\\nI really liked the concept of Daily Challenges in Leetcode. I targeted easy problems for first couple of weeks to boost confidence. Thankfully, I didn\\'t get stuck in any easy but my solutions were not optimized and needed improvements. I started doing Leetcode daily challenges from March onwards and continued my streak till sometime in August. I even got 5 badges (March 2021-July 2021). I also started brushing up my DSA and went through various YT channels and Cr*ck*ng the cod*ng int*r*iew book. (Will share the details/links towards the end of this post)\\n\\n**May 2021** :\\n\\nThis is when Facebook recruiter reached out to me and we decided to have a screening round in June.\\n\\n**June 2021** :\\n\\nBy this time, I had focused 90% of my preparation time on coding and was fairly confident by now. Had solved 350+ LC problems with main focus on mediums. I also solved ~50 Hard problems as well. I created a list of important questions during this time and had solved them 3-4 times before the interviews so that I understood the concept very well.\\nI cleared FB phone screening round. Was given 2 LC mediums and solved both pretty fast including follow-ups. It was 45 mins interview and we were done even before 40 mins. \\n\\nThis is when I started focusing on system design. Bought DDIA book and few other subscriptions.\\n\\n**July 2021** :\\n\\nCompleted reading DDIA book and went through Gr__k__ng the Sy_t_m D_s_gn interview course.\\nOnly did Leetcode daily challenges this month and went through 10-15 FB tagged problems(sorted by frequency) before the interview.\\nSpent 1-2 days in preparing for behavioural round as well (writing stories following STAR approach).\\n\\nHad 2 coding + 1 product design + 1 behavioural round with Facebook.\\n\\nIn 1 coding round I had to solve 2 LC mediums and in other round 1 LC easy and 1 LC Hard was given. Solved all 4 problems. These were all variations of FB tagged problems on Leetcode and if you have solved them, it\\'s fairly easy. Yep, FB is very predictable w.r.t. coding.\\nI had very strong feedback for 2 coding rounds, good feedback for behavioural but my product design round didn\\'t meet E5 expectations. This was I believe happened due to following reasons:\\n- Never did a mock-up before or gave any product design interview before. This was the first time for me in an interview setup so was a bit nervous a well. I would highly recommend doing some mock interviews.\\n- I had prepared extensively for system design which focuses heavily on the system side (Database, Schema, Partitioning, Replication etc.). In product design, you are expected to focus more on the API side and High level functionality.\\nI was not given a choice between product design and system design round. Talk to your recruiter and see if you can schedule the round where you are strong at.\\n\\nRecruiter reached out to me and offered to send my packet to HC for E4 as feedback for product design didn\\'t meet the bar for E5. I declined as it was not worth and a down-level for my experience.\\n\\nHad Google\\'s screening round, 1 easy and 1 medium with lot of follow-ups in both. Did well and cleared this round.\\n\\n**August 2021** :\\n\\nThis month was spent mostly in interviews and I didn\\'t practice much from coding perspective.\\n\\n**Microsoft** :\\n\\nRound 1 (Coding):\\xA0 It was a online assessment round. I had to solve 2 problems in 90 mins time. These 2 problems were new to me and I didn\\'t find them on Leetcode. I\\'ll categorize them as LC medium from algorithm perspective. But I had to write a lot of boiler-plate code unlike the usual LC mediums. You are given few visible test-cases and option to add custom test-cases. When you submit, 10-12 hidden test-cases are executed which are only visible post submission. So make sure you write your own test-cases well. After talking to various folks and going through community discussions, I also focused on code quality.\\nI was able to solve both of them in 60 mins. Spent next 15 mins in adding comments in various functions to explain what they were doing. I also mentioned time and space complexity wherever I felt it was required. This is really important as this was not the screening round for me but an actual coding round where I would be judged not just on code correctness but also on code quality/modularity. \\nMy score was 100% (I passed all the visible and hidden test-cases for both the problems)\\n\\nRound 2(Coding): 2 LC mediums with follow-ups. This went really well. Since we completed the coding exercise in ~35 mins, spent next 10 mins discussing my work experience/projects.\\n\\nRound 3(LLD): First 10-15 mins were spent on my work experience. I had to design a Parking-Lot. Went well. You can find a lot of example/tutorials on Y**t*b* etc.\\n\\nRound 4(HLD): This was the Hiring Manager round. First 20 mins spent on my projects and various discussions w.r.t. how I handled a particular scenario and why I chose one technology over other. Next was given a popular HLD question. I did very well here. I believe this round differentiated between L63/L64 level and given my interview performance, I was offered L64 eventually.\\n\\nRound 5(Director): This was mostly project discussions and behavioural questions. Nothing technical. Went well.\\n\\n**Google** :\\n\\nI had 3 coding rounds , 1 system design and 1 googlyness round.\\n\\nRound 1 (Coding): 1 ambiguous problem with follow-ups. Expectation was to gather requirements and frame the problem statement. Once the scope was defined I provided few solutions with Time/Space complexities. Coded the same. Had few follow-ups w.r.t. what changes I\\'d make to make it thread-safe etc. This went well.\\n\\nRound 2(Coding): 2 problems were given. First was related to 2-D matrix and 2nd was a graph problem. Solved both.\\n\\nRound 3(Coding): A problem statement was given related to a e-commerce website. Had to gather requirements and once the scope was clear I understood it was a graph problem. Provided solutions using both DFS and BFS approach, implemented using DFS. Follow-up was again how to make it thread-safe. Next was kind of LLD question where I was given a problem and was expected to define classes/schema and relations. I provided a generic solution which would scale even for cases outside of problem statement scope.\\n\\nRound 4(System Design): Was a given a problem related to a real life scenario. Very practical but not something you\\'d find on any YT channel or course. Since I had never seen the problem before there were no biases or known design in my mind. Kept it simple from the beginning. After gathering functional and non-functional requirements and some back-of-the-envelope estimations presented a very simple high level design. I literally drew just 3 components: client, server and a database. Then started talking about how I can scale each layer and talked about trade-offs as well. This was 1 hr round and first 45 mins went pretty well. In last 15 minutes I wasn\\'t sure about what to talk about more as I was not getting any feedback from my interviewer. I believe he only talked during first 10 mins when I was gathering requirements and he had to answer my queries. In last 15 mins I thought of providing an algorithm of how to implement my approach and talked about few data-structures as well (although this might not be in scope of system design round). After the interview I knew it won\\'t be a No Hire but was also not sure whether it would be Lean Hire or Hire etc. \\n\\nRound 5(Googlyness): This was the best round. I discussed about various scenarios and situations following the STAR approach. I had prepared a lot of answers w.r.t. ambiguity, leadership, conflict, strengths etc. but I was kind of surprised as he didn\\'t ask any direct questions which you usually prepare. I guess I only used 1 prepared story and rest was on the fly. But if you had prepared enough, you\\'ll know what to answer and how to answer and would be able to relate to it using one of your experiences/projects.\\n\\nProblems asked in Google were not directly from LC or any other platform. If you had practiced enough, you\\'ll be able to solve them.\\nMake sure you gather requirements, ask questions before jumping to solution. Keep talking and explain your thought process through-out. This is very important as interviewer would be able to judge you better and provide hints, if required.\\n\\n**Uber** :\\n\\nScreening Round: This was rather unexpected as interviewer gave me a LC Hard graph problem!! Who expects a LC hard in screening ? \\nWell, Graph theory is one of my favourite and kind of my strength too, so I solved the problem well within time limit.\\nAt the start of the interview she told that if I could write the psuedo-code, that\\'d we fine too. But since we had time, I wrote some test-cases and tried the ones she copied pasted as well. All worked, pheww. \\n\\nRound 1(Coding): 2 LC medium types. 1 related to Linked-List and other binary tree problem. Solved both.\\n\\nRound 2(Coding): 1 data-structure design problem with lot of follow-ups including making it thread safe. Similar to Design a HashMap with custom O(1) operations. I was able to come up with design and implemented the same with O(1) complexity. Couldn\\'t find the variation given to me on Leetcode.\\n\\nRound 3(System Design): Design Uber. (yep, LOL)\\n\\nRound 4 (Hiring Manager): Mostly project discussions and Behavioural questions.\\n\\nRound 5 (Behavioural) - Cancelled. I received offers from Google and Microsoft and asked them to cancel as I had a deadline to make a decision on offers.\\n\\n\\n**Atlassian** :\\n\\nI felt Atlassian\\'s interviews are really practical and they don\\'t ask questions which you won\\'t be expected to solve on a daily-basis. \\nNo screening round here, just a 30 min discussion with recruiter before scheduling interviews:\\n\\nRound 1(Coding) : 1 problem was given. I was expected to code the same in my preferred IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse etc.). Focus was mostly on data-structures and code quality. The algorithm itself was really easy if you chose correct data-structures. I used HashMap, Set and PriorityQueue in my solution. Created multiple classes, methods etc. Wrote a few test-cases. You end-up writing a lot of boiler-plate code in IDE as you need to write the main class and method, instantiate everything and then create test-cases. I even used a debugger to debug one of the test-case. This round went well.\\n\\nRound 2(Machine Coding): Asked to implement a Rate-Limiter. Used an IDE again. Was given 1 problem statement and was expected to write a Object-oriented and modular code.\\xA0 This also went well.\\n\\nFeedback of both the rounds were positive and recruiter scheduled 3 more rounds for me. 1 Design and 2 Cultural fit types. But I had to cancel them all as I had a deadline to make a decision on offers.\\n\\n\\n**Preparation Strategy**:\\n\\n**Coding**:\\n\\n- Leetcode\\n\\t- Would recommend buying premium subscription. It\\'s worth it.\\n\\t- Try to do daily Leetcode challenges. It helps you in being consistent and also covers variety of problems.\\n\\t- I used Explore card of Google and Facebook and tried to solve most of the problems.\\n\\t- Top 100 questions by frequency.\\n\\t- Top 75 LC curated: https://leetcode.com/list/xi4ci4ig/\\n- Cr*ck*g the C*d*ng Int*r*iew book\\n- YT channels/videos:\\n\\t- Data Structure lectures by Abdul Bari\\n\\t- Graph Theory by Willian Fiset\\n- Few Tips:\\n\\t- Try to solve a problem by yourself, even if you are not able to come-up with an optimal solution.\\n\\t- Think about time and space complexity of your solution. Identify sections which can be optimised and think of a better solution/ data structure.\\n\\t- Check Leetcode Solutions/ Refer Discuss section. After understanding the approach, try to implement it yourself without taking a look at code. This would help you in really understanding the concept.\\n\\t- Try to beat 90% of solutions by runtime.\\n\\n**System Design**:\\n\\n- Book: DDIA (MUST READ if targeting Google)\\n- Book: System Design _Interview by Alex Xu\\n- System Design Primer by Donne Martin\\n- Courses - Gr_k_i_g the System Design and Gr_k_i_g the Ad__nced System Design\\n- YT:\\n\\t- System Design Interview videos by Mikhail Smarshchok.\\n\\t- InfoQ videos and presentations\\n\\t- Go through Architecture of popular systems such as GFS, Kafka, Cassandra etc.\\n\\n**Behavioural**\\n\\n- YT videos by Dan Croitor\\n- Understand various Leadership principles.\\n- Go through your Resume and write stories following STAR approach Your story should project at-least one of the attribute such as taking lead, resolving conflicts, dealing with ambiguity etc..\\n- Read, Rehearse and Repeat.\\n\\nTime Management: I had a decent work-load in my day job. So spent ~2 hours on average on a working day and 4-5 hours on weekends/holidays.\\n\\nCurrent Leetcode stats: ~440 solved (E: 98, M: 272, H: 68)\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/3f9c27ea-6410-4968-aab7-72bac4454f26_1631932948.5745006.png)\\n\\n\\nFor queries w.r.t. Competitive Programming, I\\'m not a competitive programmer and I don\\'t think you need to be one to qualify any of these interviews.\\n\\n**Offers** : \\nMicrosoft (L64) : https://leetcode.com/discuss/compensation/1447596/Microsoft-or-SSE-(L64)-or-India\\nGoogle (L5) : https://leetcode.com/discuss/compensation/1466646/Google-or-L5-or-Bangalore\\n\\nHope this helps.",

Lies on all levels, starting from managers, HRs, and even founders. They lie about Unlimited PTO, Unlimited Sick Days, lie about caring company culture they try to build. Do not trust them!\\n\\nSo what\\'s going on? I was fired yesterday simply because my wife fighting cancer. I was pretty successful, and did really well in interviews, so they offered me a good salary, and promised 20 days of vacation + federal holidays, promised Unlimited Sick Days (they\\'re still promoting it), but turned out that:\\n\\n* You can\\'t take unlimited sick days, because they only advertise that. Once you ask, they gaslight and b/s you all the way\\n* You can\\'t take unlimited PTO. To take 10 days of PTO I earned I had to beg them for 2 months. Only after 2 months they approved 10 days, while I had 20+.\\n\\nAs a result, they terminated my employment right between surgeries. My wife just had surgery and barely moving, needs 24/7 attention. The next surgery is planned for 29th of September.\\n\\nAtlassian introduced their 6-week improvement plan and fired me after 2 weeks into that saying that they \"don\\'t believe anything\\'s gonna change\".\\n\\nThere are multitude of law violations in the org. For example:\\n\\n* If you have children, you\\'re less likely to get a promotion - confirmed by multiple employees, managers don\\'t even hesitate to mention that\\n* Even if you did well in interviews, they don\\'t hire you simply because they can\\n\\nThere is so much to say, so I put up a website: www.shitlassian.com where you can find more info.\\n\\nLeetcode has been so helpful to me, I wish you a good luck interviewing, and avoid Atlassian at all costs!\\n\\n",

How would you design an in-memory cache to store a stream integer values.\\n4. What are the major pros and cons of using a hashing data-structure.\\n5. What are the key factors according to you that defines good code.\\n6. What are microservices? How many microservices do you own in current role? Detailed discussion about how I came to own them and what do they do. How do they create impact to the larger picture?\\n\\nI was a bit surprised to see HR asking technical questions. \\n\\n**Round 1 - Low-Level Design (1 hour)**\\nAll coding rounds needed working code in IDE and supposed to write test cases.\\nThis was a low level design round and lasted 1 hour. Allowed to use any IDE of your choice. I was asked to code the LLD for API rate limiter.\\nDesing API Rate Limiter. Solved it. Added more complexity. Was able to solve with some hints.\\n\\n**Round 2 - Code Design (1 hour)**\\nGiven a list of [FileName, FileSize, [Collection]] - Collection is optional, i.e., a collection can have 1 or more files. Same file can be a part of more than 1 collection. \\nHow would you design a system\\n* To calculate total size of files processed.\\n* To calculate Top K collections based on size.\\nExample:\\n```\\nfile1.txt(size: 100)\\nfile2.txt(size: 200) in collection \"collection1\"\\nfile3.txt(size: 200) in collection \"collection1\"\\nfile4.txt(size: 300) in collection \"collection2\"\\nfile5.txt(size: 100)\\n```\\nOutput:\\n```\\nTotal size of files processed: 900\\nTop 2 collections:\\n- collection1 : 400\\n- collection2 : 300\\n```\\n\\t\\n**Round 3 - System Design (1 hour)**\\nAtlassian has a number of different products, each containing different types of content. As an example, let\\u2019s look at four of our products:\\nJira - Issues\\nConfluence - Web Pages\\nBitBucket - Pull Request\\nTrello - Board\\n\\nHow would you add tags for related pages across all Atlassian products.\\nHow would you scale up the system to 100 Million tag requests a day.\\n\\nApproach:\\n* Identify the functional and non-functional requirements.\\n* Based on requirements specified\\n\\t* Identify how would you store the data/DB to used.\\n\\t* HLD: Identify the system components on a high-level and how will they interact with each other.\\n\\n**Round 4 - Values (1 hour)**\\nMultiple behavioral based questions to check culture fit.\\n\\n**Round 5 - Management Round (1 hour)**\\nDeep discussion about past experiences.\\n\\nReceived an offer after a week.\\n\\nNote: Unlike other companies, Atlassian doesn\\'t ask LC questions. They focus on seeing whether the candidate can solve real world problems. Really wish all companies moved to this pattern of interview.",

Karat screen with 2 dsa and a system design rapid fire. Cleared as I had previously did similar thing for indeed/coinbase.\\n2. DSA+LLD : dsa question all over leetcode, just need to take care of clean coding practices.\\n3. DSA : again all over internet, suggested 2 approaches, written clean & modular code for 1 of the approach.\\n4.  HLD : Not over leetcode and not the common one but I did well from requirements to desiging the whole system.\\n5.  Values : Similar to other posts covering 5-6 company values\\n6.  Management round : similar to other experiences covering examples from past experience\\n\\n**Uber L5a** | Difficulty Hard | Bangalore\\n1. DSA : popular leetcode medium on graph but slightly changed to hard if you were to space optimize the graph from matrix to map, clean code & completion of both the matrix & map approach within 1 hour was enough for interview to give me a hire call.\\n2. DSA+LLD : Never seen before on leetcode posts, written interface and 2 classes for 2 use cases. I could write only 1 but correctly, still got a hire without being able to comlete both the use cases.\\n3. System Design : Not so popular design question but managed to complete the given use cases within time with a nice diagram. \\n4. Bar raiser (Past design) : Past technical project explanatin and tech learnings, challanges etc\\n5. Hiring Manager : Best hiring manager round with examples from past experience for typing behavioural scenarios\\n\\n**TC Offered : ~130L (approx, ceilling)**\\n\\n**Rippling L7** | Difficulty Medium-Hard | Bangalore\\n1. DSA : Never solved before but medium difficulty leetcode question\\n2. DSA : others have posted similar question, not on lc\\n3. Design-1 : other have posted similar to that\\n4. Design-2 : again similar to other posts on lc\\n5. HM : easiest, few basic question on current work experience + product demo. I asked a lot of questions on tech behind and it turned me off\\n\\nDecided not to join Rippling because of their WLB, inflated valuation & lower quality engg work so gave them a very high expectation numbers, recruiter never came back (as expected).\\n\\n**Vmware SMTS** | Difficulty Medium | Bangalore\\n1.  Initial screening : With Director, discussion on current work & what they are looking for, basic technical questions\\n2.  DSA [1 hour] : Digging on past work exp and then solved 2 questions medium lc\\n3. LLD+Coding [1 hour ] : role was golang+kubernetes specific, so provided the lld & written code in golang.\\n4. DSA [1 hour] : 1 LC medium on binary tree, provided clean code, ran it. \\n\\n**TC Offered : ~100L** with very low RSUs, I was most interested to join this but declined due to broadcom stuff.\\n\\n**Google L5** | Difficulty medium | Bangalore\\n1. DSA : medium difficult question, explained & written clean code. interviewer gave feedback with nitpicks & red flagged the revisions which i made while initial approach vs implementation, obviously you will uncover things as you go, but looks like they want you to mug up solutions and vomit out perfectly.\\n2. DSA : medium difficulty, non lc, explained and solved just fine, again got nitpick feedback\\n3. DSA : lc hard, explained & code covered most execpt an edge case, revised the approach but couldn\\'t fix code due to strict time.\\n4. Design : Very domain specific design question, covered most aspects of design and got nitpicked feedback.\\n\\nAsked if I am interested in L4, declined without a second thought, heard downlevel stories on blind but it was first hand experience and Google interview feedbacks were a big time turn off. Looks like if you mug-up code+time/space complexities and give answers without thinking/revising, you are good, otherwise you struggled to do this/that. Obviously you are not supposed to evaluate your approaches this vs that while you code, example writing a separate utility function vs putting something in complex if condition, I got a negative nitpick for this one.\\n\\n**Eightfold Senior/Lead Engineer** | Medium difficulty\\n1. LLD : Gave some vauge robot problem, had to design class intereaction and their functions\\n2. HLD : Domain specific question, solved it and gave some lld and hld. The interviewer was some 3 year exp guy with not so good communication skills (no ego issues for sure over exp). I had to litterly explain him that this/that features is provided by Kafka which I used in my hld. This round turned me off with the quality of their engineering team.\\n3. HM : Past work, what I a looking for in new job etc.\\nDeclined to enggage as they said they can\\'t match my previous offers with all cash. I was not interested to hold paper esops over public RSUs from others.\\n\\n**Confluent Senior Engineer** | Hard difficulty level (Rejected)\\nSimilar to what others have posted. \\n1. DSA  : DP Hard \\n2. Concurrency coding : popular concurrency interview question\\n3. Design-1 : similar to twitter/insta feed generation\\n4. Design-2 : popular hld question from gr...ing sys-de88gn\\nI got hire except deisgn-1 round for minor things and was rejected. I had to improve a lot on concurrency problems for Confluent and they helped me later on in other interviews.\\n\\n**Rubrik Senior Engineer** | Medium-Hard (Rejected)\\n1. Concurrency Coding : popular concurrency question\\n2. DSA : popular design+dsa question using dll & map\\n3. Design-1 : similar to other posts\\n4. Design-2 : design of one of the linkedin feature\\n5. HM : past experience\\n\\n\\n**UiPath Senior Engineer** | Medium (Rejected)\\n1. DSA : sliding window based popular question\\n2. DSA : never saw on lc, gave a wrong greedy solution, which looked to be working for many test cases and interviewer could give single example to break the wrong solution, realized after interview.\\n3. Design (LLD) : lld, class diagram of something like stackoverflow. \\nRejected after this.\\n\\n**Skyflow Senior Engineer** | Medium-Hard (Rejected)\\n1. DSA : something on binary tree, solved\\n2. DSA : never seen something like this on LC but solved & written the code \\n3.

Dont want to post all the questions just incase, if I get rejected I\\'ll go ahead and post screenshots. \\n\\nQuestion 1:\\n* Simple max difference: Given an array return the max difference nums[j] - nums[i] for pairs nums[i] <= nums[j] where i < j. (I wasted a lot of time on this problem for some dumb incorrect if statement, think through your solution before solving this should be a quick 10 min problem) \\n\\t\\t* Ex. 7,2,3,10,1 the return value would be 10-2 and not 10-1 because 1 comes after the 10.\\n\\nQuestion 2:\\n* Return number of subarrays that statisfy the condition given a number n where n is the amount of even numbers that may exist in the subarray and subarrays cannot end or start with same values (I skipped this one). Ex. 1,2,3,4,5 and n=2 you would return 4: [1,2,3], [1,2,3,4] [2,3,4,5]  [3,4,5]\\n\\nQuestion 3:\\n*  Problem can be solved using Union find. Given array of edges calculate size of each tree take their square root if their size > 1 and add them up, if their size is 1 then just add 1.

I hope it helps anyone else out there that is interviewing with Atlassian.\\n\\nYOE: <1\\n\\nPhone screen and System Design Round:\\n\\nI applied to atlassian online and got a call a week later form the recruiter. She asked me a few basic questions revolving around my work and my expereince. She did ask specifically \"have you contributed to the architecture or design for any of the projects that you have been on?\", which I thought was a question that I should share. \\n\\n\\nRound 1: System design \\nAfter the phone screen I got invited to do the first round which was a system design round. They asked me to build an application that would schedule reminders for users who called it. I chose a MySQL database to take advantage of ACID transactions and we talked thorugh how to scale it up and what potential drawbacks would be. For this round just study system design specifically things like sharding, indexing, load-balancing, localization, etc...\\n\\n\\nI was told that I did well on the first round and that they wanted to move on to the onsite interview.\\n\\nOn-site 5 Round Interview:\\n\\nRound 1: Coding Design\\n\\nWas asked to code the snake game. Ask clarifying questions with regards to the input and the outputs of the functions. For this round I did not get much help from the interviewer since she said that everything was my choice. Ended up using a deque to represent the snake body and a map to check for collisions. This question is on leetcode under the atlassian tag so it should be easy to practice.\\n\\nRound 2: DS/Algo\\n\\nGiven a list of votes by seperate judges return the top 3 winners. The first 3 places of the judges votes are given points depending on their place in the judges votes. Don\\'t remeber what I did exactly and how the problem changed, but it is similar to Rank Teams by Votes on leetcode. Was asked about time complexity and if the code is production ready.\\n\\nRound 3: Hiring Manager round\\n\\nWas asked about previous experience and a bunch of behavioral questions. Have you ever recieved negative feedback? Name a time that you wanted to make something for a customer even after facing heavy opposition from team members and team leads?\\n\\nRound 4: System Design Round\\n\\nWas asked to design a system that allowed users to select their favorite colors and share them with friends. Had to decide which type of database to use, the schema, some queries. Was also asked to design the API\\'s as well as describe how it would be called. The discussion continued and we eventually talked about scaling it up, and how to make sure the system was performing as it was supposed to.\\n\\nRound 5: Values interview\\n\\nAsked behavioral questions revolving around Atlassian Values. Just study those and make stories for each of them and you should be fine.\\n\\n\\nResult:\\nWas offered a Junior position with a TC of 170k\\n\\nMore about the offer:\\n121k base\\n37.5k stocks + refreshers\\n12k bonus\\n\\n",

Asked a few clarifying questions. Took me about 45-50 mins to get the code running. The interviewer then tested it on a few test cases. After being satisfied he modified the question so that we any usused requests quota in a given time interval are moved to the next interval. I made the code changes but we were running out of time and I was getting wrong o/p. The interviewer was nice enoough to give me anouther 5-10 mins. I was able to find the bug and resolve it. He then tested it with more test cases and the code gave the correct output. Overall, this round went very well.\\n\\n**Round 2 - DSA**\\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/rank-teams-by-votes/\\nInitially, I didn\\'t have to worry about tie breaking which made the question a LC easy. I was then asked to write all the test cases that I would have used to make this code production ready. Then the tie breaking condition was added. There were a few tweaks to the wordings but the crux was the same. I was using separate classes for the modelling instead of just using maps like we normally do in DSA questions so that the code looks more mature. We were kind of left with only 15ish mins now because explaining the tests I had come up with itself took like 10 mins. I quickly came up with the algo and coded it up. The algorithm was correct but there were probably a few bugs in the implementation coz of which the code gave incorrect output. However, this time, I was not given any extra time and the interview was over. This interview was just okay-ish as I couldn\\'t get the code completely running correctly for the followup.\\n\\n**Round 3 - HLD**\\n```Desgin a common tagging system for all atlassian products and find k popular tags. ```\\nAsked a lot of clarifying questions. Started off with BOE calculations, APIs, DB, HLD diagram, sharding, fault tolerance and then finally optimizations. There was a decent amount of cross-questioning in between by the interviewer so be prepared to have a good reason backing your design choices and know the trade offs. Overall, this round went well.\\n\\n**Round 4 - Values**\\nIt was all about \"Tell me a about a time\" types of questions. Just go through all the 5-6 Atlassian values and make up stories around them and you will be good. I think this round is just to highlight any red flags which might be a problem in a collaborative enviornment.\\n\\n**Round 5 - Management**\\nThis round has some overlap with the values round. Here, you will also be asked about your previous experience, your current duties, time when you had planned for a project end to end etc. \\n\\nOnce you clear all the above rounds, you will be matched with different teams. You will have calls with the HMs from different teams but they are not interviews. Its a 2-way street where you can also ask a lot of questions regarding the team to judge the fittment.\\n\\nCompensation: https://leetcode.com/discuss/compensation/2228927/Atlassian-or-SDE2-or-BengaluruRemote",

This round started with the introduction from both ends.\\nLater, he asked me to explain my favourite project. You should be thorough with your\\nprojects. I was asked to follow up on questions based on that.\\nAfter this, he moved to CS subjects.\\n\\nDBMS: In DBMS, he asked me about Indexing, Transaction, SQL queries, difference\\nbetween WHERE and HAVING. (He wants me to explain everything with real examples).\\n\\nOperating System: How \\u201Chelloworld.c\\u201D program will execute in operating system. Explain\\ncomplete procedure.\\n\\nComputer Networks: Explain OSI model. Suppose we are using a chat application, explain\\nhow data (the message) flows through the OSI layers.

Then, he asked me to name the protocols used in each layer.\\n\\nThis round lasted for 60-70 mins.\\n\\n**Round 3 (HR and Values Round):**\\n\\nIt was an HR cum Values round. The interviewer was very senior. It also started with the\\nintroduction from both ends. He then asked me to brief about my projects. After that he\\nasked me lot of questions related to team work, conflict management and past leadership\\nroles. It would be great if you include their core values in your answers.\\n\\nThis round lasted for 60-65 mins.\\n\\n**Round 4 (Tech round 2):**\\n\\nIt was a DSA round, started with introduction from both ends. He then gave me a question\\nto write a function to generate random number in a given range. Then using this function, I\\nneed to solve the following question.\\n\\nThere is an array of distinct numbers. We need to find k different numbers from array. The\\nindexes of these numbers are found using that random number function. The worst case\\ntime complexity of this question is infinity because the function could generate same index\\nat every call. We discuss multiple solutions for this question and finally came to most\\noptimized solution of O(n) time complexity.\\n\\nSecond problem, there is an infinite stream of numbers as input, find k maximum elements\\nat any time. Follow up question is, what if k is variable?\\n\\nLast question, how to implement a hash map?\\n\\nThis round lasted for 55-60 mins.\\n\\n**Final Result:** **SELECTED**\\n\\nHope this article helps to get an understanding of the interview process at Atlassian.\\n\\n**All the best :)**",

Freelancing Platform A customer has posted several web development projects on a freelancing platform, and various web developers have put in bids for these projects. Given the bid amounts and their corresponding projects, what is the minimum amount the customer can pay to have all the projects completed? Note: If any project has no bids, return -1. Example numProjects = 3 projects. projectld = (2,0, 1, 2] bid = [8, 7, 6, 9]. \\u2022 projectld[i] is aligned with bidii] \\u2022 The first web developer bid 8 currency units for project 2. \\u2022 The second web developer bid 7 currency units for project 0. \\u2022 The third web developer bid 6 currency units for project 1. \\u2022 The fourth web developer bld 9 currency units for project 2. There is only one choice of who to hire for project 0, and it will cost 7. Likewise, there is only one choice for project 1, which will cost 6. For project 2 it is optimal to hire the first web developer, instead of the fourth, and doing so will cost 8. So the final answer is 7 + 6 + 8 = 21. If instead there were n = 4 projects, the answer would be since there were no bids If instead there were n = 4 projects, the answer would be -1 since there were no blds received on the fourth project. Function Description Complete the function minCost in the editor below. minCost has the following parameters: int numProjects the total number of projects posted by the client (labeled from 0 ton) Int projectldin): an array of Integers denoting the projects that the freelancers bid on int bidan): an array of Integers denoting the bid amounts posted by the freelancers Returns: long the minimum cost the client can spend to complete all projects, or -1 if any project has no bids. Constraints 1 s numProjects, ns 5x105 Os projectldi<n 1 s bid[i] s 10\\xB0 . Input Format For Custom Testing The first line contains an Integer, num Projects. The next line contains an integer, n, which denotes the number of elements in array projectld). Each line i of the n subsequent lines (where 0 si<n) contains an integer, projectld[i]. The next line contains an integer, n, which denotes the number of elements in array bid. Each line i of the n subsequent lines (where Osi<n) contains an integer, bid[i]. Sample Case o Sample Input STDIN Function ---- 2 5 \\u2192 numProjects = 2 projectId[] size n = 5 projectId = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1] 0 \\u2192 1 1 1 5 \\u2192 bid[] size n = 5 bid = [4, 74, 47, 744, 7] 4 74 47 744 7 Sample Output 11 Explanation The bids are as follows: \\u2022 The first web developer bid 4 currency units for project 0. \\u2022 The second web developer bld 74 currency units for project 1. \\u2022 The third web developer bid 47 currency units for project 0. The fourth web developer bid 744 currency units for proiect 1 \\u2022 The second web developer bld 74 currency units for project 1. \\u2022 The third web developer bld 47 currency units for project 0. \\u2022 The fourth web developer bld 744 currency units for project 1. \\u2022 The fifth web developer bid 7 currency units for project 1. The optimal solution is to hire the first web developer to complete project (which costs 4) and to hire the fifth web developer to complete project 1 (which costs 7). This brings the total cost to 11. Sample Case 1 Sample Input STDIN Function 2. 2. numProjects = 2 projectId[] size n = 2 \\u2192 projectId = [1, 1] 1 1 2 bid[] size n = 2 bid = [4, 7] 4 > 7 Sample Output -1 Explanation Because there are no bids for project 0, the function should return -1.",

      "content": "There were 2 coding rounds with a single coding question each. Expectation was working code with tests. \\n\\n1. Design an API rate limiter which can allows R requests in T seconds.  [1st round] --- Solved using a map of seconds and counts. For every hit the isAllowed function would check the last T seconds count. But test was failing due to some edge case and since no time was left it was left that way. From what I sensed via leetcode and glassdoor, this is a standard question in Atlassian coding rounds. \\n2. Given list of {page-id, size, section-id} find the largest N sections in sorted order and also the overall size of all pages. [2nd round] --- Solved using hashmap and min-heap of size N. Was able to come up with correct space ( O(inputsize) ) and time complexity ( O(inputsize + NlogN )\\n\\nFeedback was not good for both. For 1st round since some tests were failing I assume the feedback was -ve. But for 2nd round there were no clear reasons for a negative feedback.\\n\\nOverall it was a bad experience interviewing with Atlassian.",

As my 2 years bond is now going to complete, I am looking for a switch but can\\'t see any good product based company looking for Mulesoft Developers. Hence, I am parallelly brushing up my DSA skills for the interviews. So, what will you suggest me to prepare for along with DSA like Full stack, FrontEnd, Backend, Android, so that I can apply for 10+ LPA. I have already worked upon this technologies in college but that link has been broken because I got pulled into Mulesoft but yeah I have interest in all of these(Full stack, FrontEnd, Backend, Android). With what should I proceed now? Any suggestions please?",
